Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework 2005, recommends that children’s life at school
must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from
the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap
between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on
the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to
discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction
of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education
(1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers
will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative
activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom,
children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them
by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of
the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating
creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in
learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual
calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.
The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a
source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The
textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to
opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and
activities requiring hands-on experience.

Rationalisation of Content in the Textbook
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on
students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content
load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset.
In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the
textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT
across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
•

Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same
class

•

Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject

•

Difficulty level

•

Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions
from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peerlearning

•

Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes
given above.

Preface
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) had constituted
21 Focus Groups on Teaching of various subjects related to School Education, to
review the National Curriculum Framework for School Education - 2000 (NCFSE 2000) in face of new emerging challenges and transformations occurring in the fields
of content and pedagogy under the contexts of National and International spectrum of
school education. These Focus Groups made general and specific comments in their
respective areas. Consequently, based on these reports of Focus Groups, National
Curriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 was developed.
NCERT designed the new syllabi and constituted Textbook Development Teams
for Classes XI and XII to prepare textbooks in mathematics under the new guidelines
and new syllabi. The textbook for Class XI is already in use, which was brought in
2005.
The first draft of the present book (Class XII) was prepared by the team consisting
of NCERT faculty, experts and practicing teachers. The draft was refined by the
development team in different meetings. This draft of the book was exposed to a
group of practicing teachers teaching mathematics at higher secondary stage in different
parts of the country, in a review workshop organised by the NCERT at Delhi. The
teachers made useful comments and suggestions which were incorporated in the draft
textbook. The draft textbook was finalised by an editorial board constituted out of the
development team. Finally, the Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics and the
Monitoring Committee constituted by the HRD Ministry, Government of India have
approved the draft of the textbook.
In the fitness of things, let us cite some of the essential features dominating the
textbook. These characteristics have reflections in almost all the chapters. The existing
textbook contain 13 main chapters and two appendices. Each Chapter contain the
followings:
§ Introduction: Highlighting the importance of the topic; connection with earlier
studied topics; brief mention about the new concepts to be discussed in the
chapter.
§ Organisation of chapter into sections comprising one or more concepts/sub
concepts.
§ Motivating and introducing the concepts/sub concepts. Illustrations have been
provided wherever possible.

viii
§ Proofs/problem solving involving deductive or inductive reasoning, multiplicity
of approaches wherever possible have been inducted.
§ Geometric viewing / visualisation of concepts have been emphasised whenever
needed.
§ Applications of mathematical concepts have also been integrated with allied
subjects like science and social sciences.
§ Adequate and variety of examples/exercises have been given in each section.
§ For refocusing and strengthening the understanding and skill of problem solving
and applicabilities, miscellaneous types of examples/exercises have been
provided involving two or more sub concepts at a time at the end of the chapter.
The scope of challenging problems to talented minority have been reflected
conducive to the recommendation as reflected in NCF-2005.
§ For more motivational purpose, brief historical background of topics have been
provided at the end of the chapter and at the beginning of each chapter relevant
quotation and photograph of eminent mathematician who have contributed
significantly in the development of the topic undertaken, are also provided.
§ Lastly, for direct recapitulation of main concepts, formulas and results, brief
summary of the chapter has also been provided.
I am thankful to Professor Krishan Kumar, Director, NCERT who constituted the
team and invited me to join this national endeavor for the improvement of mathematics
education. He has provided us with an enlightened perspective and a very conducive
environment. This made the task of preparing the book much more enjoyable and
rewarding. I express my gratitude to Professor J.V. Narlikar, Chairperson of the
Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics, for his specific suggestions and advice
towards the improvement of the book from time to time. I, also, thank Prof. G. Ravindra,
Joint Director, NCERT for his help from time to time.
I express my sincere thanks to Professor Hukum Singh, Chief Coordinator and
Head DESM, Dr. V. P. Singh, Coordinator and Professor S. K. Singh Gautam who
have been helping for the success of this project academically as well as
administratively. Also, I would like to place on records my appreciation and thanks to
all the members of the team and the teachers who have been associated with this
noble cause in one or the other form.

RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
vThere is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics ... . It may
be very hard to define mathematical beauty but that is just as true of
beauty of any kind, we may not know quite what we mean by a
beautiful poem, but that does not prevent us from recognising
one when we read it. — G. H. HARDY v

1.1 Introduction
Recall that the notion of relations and functions, domain,
co-domain and range have been introduced in Class XI
along with different types of specific real valued functions
and their graphs. The concept of the term ‘relation’ in
mathematics has been drawn from the meaning of relation
in English language, according to which two objects or
quantities are related if there is a recognisable connection
or link between the two objects or quantities. Let A be
the set of students of Class XII of a school and B be the
set of students of Class XI of the same school. Then some
of the examples of relations from A to B are
(i) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: a is brother of b},
Lejeune Dirichlet
(1805-1859)
(ii) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: a is sister of b},
(iii) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: age of a is greater than age of b},
(iv) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: total marks obtained by a in the final examination is less than
the total marks obtained by b in the final examination},
(v) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: a lives in the same locality as b}. However, abstracting from
this, we define mathematically a relation R from A to B as an arbitrary subset
of A × B.
If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b under the relation R and we write as
a R b. In general, (a, b) ∈ R, we do not bother whether there is a recognisable
connection or link between a and b. As seen in Class XI, functions are special kind of
relations.
In this chapter, we will study different types of relations and functions, composition
of functions, invertible functions and binary operations.

MATHEMATICS

1.2 Types of Relations
In this section, we would like to study different types of relations. We know that a
relation in a set A is a subset of A × A. Thus, the empty set φ and A × A are two
extreme relations. For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} given by
R = {(a, b): a – b = 10}. This is the empty set, as no pair (a, b) satisfies the condition
a – b = 10. Similarly, R′ = {(a, b) : | a – b | ≥ 0} is the whole set A × A, as all pairs
(a, b) in A × A satisfy | a – b | ≥ 0. These two extreme examples lead us to the
following definitions.
Definition 1 A relation R in a set A is called empty relation, if no element of A is
related to any element of A, i.e., R = φ ⊂ A × A.
Definition 2 A relation R in a set A is called universal relation, if each element of A
is related to every element of A, i.e., R = A × A.
Both the empty relation and the universal relation are some times called trivial
relations.
Example 1 Let A be the set of all students of a boys school. Show that the relation R
in A given by R = {(a, b) : a is sister of b} is the empty relation and R′ = {(a, b) : the
difference between heights of a and b is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation.
Solution Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any
student of the school. Hence, R = φ, showing that R is the empty relation. It is also
obvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be
less than 3 meters. This shows that R′ = A × A is the universal relation.
Remark In Class XI, we have seen two ways of representing a relation, namely raster
method and set builder method. However, a relation R in the set {1, 2, 3, 4} defined by R
= {(a, b) : b = a + 1} is also expressed as a R b if and only if
b = a + 1 by many authors. We may also use this notation, as and when convenient.
If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b and we denote it as a R b.
One of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics,
is an equivalence relation. To study equivalence relation, we first consider three
types of relations, namely reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
Definition 3 A relation R in a set A is called
(i) reflexive, if (a, a) ∈ R, for every a ∈ A,
(ii) symmetric, if (a1, a2) ∈ R implies that (a2, a1) ∈ R, for all a1, a2 ∈ A.
(iii) transitive, if (a1, a2) ∈ R and (a2, a3) ∈ R implies that (a1, a3) ∈ R, for all a1, a2,
a3 ∈ A.

RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS

Definition 4 A relation R in a set A is said to be an equivalence relation if R is
reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
Example 2 Let T be the set of all triangles in a plane with R a relation in T given by
R = {(T1, T2) : T1 is congruent to T2}. Show that R is an equivalence relation.
Solution R is reflexive, since every triangle is congruent to itself. Further,
(T1, T2) ∈ R ⇒ T1 is congruent to T2 ⇒ T2 is congruent to T1 ⇒ (T2, T1) ∈ R. Hence,
R is symmetric. Moreover, (T1, T2), (T2, T3) ∈ R ⇒ T1 is congruent to T2 and T2 is
congruent to T3 ⇒ T1 is congruent to T3 ⇒ (T1, T3) ∈ R. Therefore, R is an equivalence
relation.
Example 3 Let L be the set of all lines in a plane and R be the relation in L defined as
R = {(L1, L2) : L1 is perpendicular to L2}. Show that R is symmetric but neither
reflexive nor transitive.
Solution R is not reflexive, as a line L1 can not be perpendicular to itself, i.e., (L1, L1)
∉ R. R is symmetric as (L1, L2) ∈ R
⇒
L1 is perpendicular to L2
⇒

L2 is perpendicular to L1

⇒

(L2, L1) ∈ R.

R is not transitive. Indeed, if L1 is perpendicular to L2 and
Fig 1.1
L2 is perpendicular to L3, then L1 can never be perpendicular to
L3. In fact, L1 is parallel to L3, i.e., (L1, L2) ∈ R, (L2, L3) ∈ R but (L1, L3) ∉ R.
Example 4 Show that the relation R in the set {1, 2, 3} given by R = {(1, 1), (2, 2),
(3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)} is reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive.
Solution R is reflexive, since (1, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 3) lie in R. Also, R is not symmetric,
as (1, 2) ∈ R but (2, 1) ∉ R. Similarly, R is not transitive, as (1, 2) ∈ R and (2, 3) ∈ R
but (1, 3) ∉ R.
Example 5 Show that the relation R in the set Z of integers given by
R = {(a, b) : 2 divides a – b}
is an equivalence relation.
Solution R is reflexive, as 2 divides (a – a) for all a ∈ Z. Further, if (a, b) ∈ R, then
2 divides a – b. Therefore, 2 divides b – a. Hence, (b, a) ∈ R, which shows that R is
symmetric. Similarly, if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then a – b and b – c are divisible by
2. Now, a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) is even (Why?). So, (a – c) is divisible by 2. This
shows that R is transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation in Z.

MATHEMATICS

In Example 5, note that all even integers are related to zero, as (0, ± 2), (0, ± 4)
etc., lie in R and no odd integer is related to 0, as (0, ± 1), (0, ± 3) etc., do not lie in R.
Similarly, all odd integers are related to one and no even integer is related to one.
Therefore, the set E of all even integers and the set O of all odd integers are subsets of
Z satisfying following conditions:
(i) All elements of E are related to each other and all elements of O are related to
each other.
(ii) No element of E is related to any element of O and vice-versa.
(iii) E and O are disjoint and Z = E ∪ O.
The subset E is called the equivalence class containing zero and is denoted by
[0]. Similarly, O is the equivalence class containing 1 and is denoted by [1]. Note that
[0] ≠ [1], [0] = [2r] and [1] = [2r + 1], r ∈ Z. Infact, what we have seen above is true
for an arbitrary equivalence relation R in a set X. Given an arbitrary equivalence
relation R in an arbitrary set X, R divides X into mutually disjoint subsets Ai called
partitions or subdivisions of X satisfying:
(i) all elements of Ai are related to each other, for all i.
(ii) no element of Ai is related to any element of Aj , i ≠ j.
(iii) ∪ Aj = X and Ai ∩ Aj = φ, i ≠ j.
The subsets Ai are called equivalence classes. The interesting part of the situation
is that we can go reverse also. For example, consider a subdivision of the set Z given
by three mutually disjoint subsets A1, A2 and A3 whose union is Z with
A1 = {x ∈ Z : x is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 6, – 3, 0, 3, 6, ...}
A2 = {x ∈ Z : x – 1 is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 5, – 2, 1, 4, 7, ...}
A3 = {x ∈ Z : x – 2 is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 4, – 1, 2, 5, 8, ...}
Define a relation R in Z given by R = {(a, b) : 3 divides a – b}. Following the
arguments similar to those used in Example 5, we can show that R is an equivalence
relation. Also, A1 coincides with the set of all integers in Z which are related to zero, A2
coincides with the set of all integers which are related to 1 and A3 coincides with the
set of all integers in Z which are related to 2. Thus, A1 = [0], A2 = [1] and A3 = [2].
In fact, A1 = [3r], A2 = [3r + 1] and A3 = [3r + 2], for all r ∈ Z.
Example 6 Let R be the relation defined in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} by
R = {(a, b) : both a and b are either odd or even}. Show that R is an equivalence
relation. Further, show that all the elements of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each
other and all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to each other, but no
element of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} is related to any element of the subset {2, 4, 6}.

Solution Given any element a in A, both a and a must be either odd or even, so
that (a, a) ∈ R. Further, (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ both a and b must be either odd or even
⇒ (b, a) ∈ R. Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ all elements a, b, c, must be
either even or odd simultaneously ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R. Hence, R is an equivalence relation.
Further, all the elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each other, as all the elements
of this subset are odd. Similarly, all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to
each other, as all of them are even. Also, no element of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} can be
related to any element of {2, 4, 6}, as elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are odd, while elements
of {2, 4, 6} are even.

1.3 Types of Functions
The notion of a function along with some special functions like identity function, constant
function, polynomial function, rational function, modulus function, signum function etc.
along with their graphs have been given in Class XI.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two functions have also been
studied. As the concept of function is of paramount importance in mathematics and
among other disciplines as well, we would like to extend our study about function from
where we finished earlier. In this section, we would like to study different types of
functions.
Consider the functions f1, f2, f3 and f4 given by the following diagrams.
In Fig 1.2, we observe that the images of distinct elements of X1 under the function
f1 are distinct, but the image of two distinct elements 1 and 2 of X1 under f2 is same,
namely b. Further, there are some elements like e and f in X2 which are not images of
any element of X1 under f1, while all elements of X3 are images of some elements of X1
under f3. The above observations lead to the following definitions:
Definition 5 A function f : X → Y is defined to be one-one (or injective), if the images
of distinct elements of X under f are distinct, i.e., for every x1, x2 ∈ X, f (x1) = f (x2)
implies x1 = x2. Otherwise, f is called many-one.
The function f1 and f4 in Fig 1.2 (i) and (iv) are one-one and the function f2 and f3
in Fig 1.2 (ii) and (iii) are many-one.
Definition 6 A function f : X → Y is said to be onto (or surjective), if every element
of Y is the image of some element of X under f, i.e., for every y ∈ Y, there exists an
element x in X such that f (x) = y.
The function f3 and f4 in Fig 1.2 (iii), (iv) are onto and the function f1 in Fig 1.2 (i) is
not onto as elements e, f in X2 are not the image of any element in X1 under f1.

MATHEMATICS

Fig 1.2 (i) to (iv)

Remark f : X → Y is onto if and only if Range of f = Y.
Definition 7 A function f : X → Y is said to be one-one and onto (or bijective), if f is
both one-one and onto.
The function f4 in Fig 1.2 (iv) is one-one and onto.
Example 7 Let A be the set of all 50 students of Class X in a school. Let f : A → N be
function defined by f (x) = roll number of the student x. Show that f is one-one
but not onto.
Solution No two different students of the class can have same roll number. Therefore,
f must be one-one. We can assume without any loss of generality that roll numbers of
students are from 1 to 50. This implies that 51 in N is not roll number of any student of
the class, so that 51 can not be image of any element of X under f. Hence, f is not onto.
Example 8 Show that the function f : N → N, given by f (x) = 2x, is one-one but not
onto.
Solution The function f is one-one, for f (x1) = f (x2) ⇒ 2x1 = 2x2 ⇒ x1 = x2. Further,
f is not onto, as for 1 ∈ N, there does not exist any x in N such that f (x) = 2x = 1.

Example 9 Prove that the function f : R → R, given by f (x) = 2x, is one-one and onto.

Example 10 Show that the function f : N → N, given by f (1) = f (2) = 1 and f (x) = x – 1,
for every x > 2, is onto but not one-one.
Solution f is not one-one, as f (1) = f (2) = 1. But f is onto, as given any y ∈ N, y ≠ 1,
we can choose x as y + 1 such that f (y + 1) = y + 1 – 1 = y. Also for 1 ∈ N, we
have f (1) = 1.
Example 11 Show that the function f : R → R,
defined as f (x) = x2, is neither one-one nor onto.
Solution Since f (– 1) = 1 = f (1), f is not oneone. Also, the element – 2 in the co-domain R is
not image of any element x in the domain R
(Why?). Therefore f is not onto.
Example 12 Show that f : N → N, given by
f ( x) =

x + 1,if x is odd,
x − 1,if x is even

is both one-one and onto.

MATHEMATICS

Solution Suppose f (x1) = f (x2). Note that if x1 is odd and x2 is even, then we will have
x1 + 1 = x2 – 1, i.e., x2 – x1 = 2 which is impossible. Similarly, the possibility of x1 being
even and x2 being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument. Therefore,
both x1 and x2 must be either odd or even. Suppose both x1 and x2 are odd. Then
f (x1) = f (x2) ⇒ x1 + 1 = x2 + 1 ⇒ x1 = x2. Similarly, if both x1 and x2 are even, then also
f (x1) = f (x2) ⇒ x1 – 1 = x2 – 1 ⇒ x1 = x2. Thus, f is one-one. Also, any odd number
2r + 1 in the co-domain N is the image of 2r + 2 in the domain N and any even number
2r in the co-domain N is the image of 2r – 1 in the domain N. Thus, f is onto.
Example 13 Show that an onto function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} is always one-one.
Solution Suppose f is not one-one. Then there exists two elements, say 1 and 2 in the
domain whose image in the co-domain is same. Also, the image of 3 under f can be
only one element. Therefore, the range set can have at the most two elements of the
co-domain {1, 2, 3}, showing that f is not onto, a contradiction. Hence, f must be one-one.
Example 14 Show that a one-one function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} must be onto.
Solution Since f is one-one, three elements of {1, 2, 3} must be taken to 3 different
elements of the co-domain {1, 2, 3} under f. Hence, f has to be onto.
Remark The results mentioned in Examples 13 and 14 are also true for an arbitrary
finite set X, i.e., a one-one function f : X → X is necessarily onto and an onto map
f : X → X is necessarily one-one, for every finite set X. In contrast to this, Examples 8
and 10 show that for an infinite set, this may not be true. In fact, this is a characteristic
difference between a finite and an infinite set.

1.4 Composition of Functions and Invertible Function
Definition 8 Let f : A → B and g : B → C be two functions. Then the composition of
f and g, denoted by gof, is defined as the function gof : A → C given by
gof (x) = g(f (x)), ∀ x ∈ A.

Fig 1.5

Example 15 Let f : {2, 3, 4, 5} → {3, 4, 5, 9} and g : {3, 4, 5, 9} → {7, 11, 15} be
functions defined as f (2) = 3, f (3) = 4, f (4) = f (5) = 5 and g (3) = g (4) = 7 and
g (5) = g (9) = 11. Find gof.
Solution We have gof (2) = g (f (2)) = g (3) = 7, gof (3) = g (f (3)) = g (4) = 7,
gof (4) = g (f (4)) = g (5) = 11 and gof (5) = g (5) = 11.
Example 16 Find gof and fog, if f : R → R and g : R → R are given by f (x) = cos x
and g (x) = 3x2. Show that gof ≠ fog.
Solution We have gof (x) = g (f (x)) = g (cos x) = 3 (cos x)2 = 3 cos2 x. Similarly,
fog (x) = f (g (x)) = f (3x2) = cos (3x2). Note that 3cos2 x ≠ cos 3x2, for x = 0. Hence,
gof ≠ fog.
Definition 9 A function f : X → Y is defined to be invertible, if there exists a function
g : Y → X such that gof = IX and fog = IY. The function g is called the inverse of f and
is denoted by f –1.
Thus, if f is invertible, then f must be one-one and onto and conversely, if f is
one-one and onto, then f must be invertible. This fact significantly helps for proving a
function f to be invertible by showing that f is one-one and onto, specially when the
actual inverse of f is not to be determined.
Example 17 Let f : N → Y be a function defined as f (x) = 4x + 3, where,
Y = {y ∈ N : y = 4x + 3 for some x ∈ N }. Show that f is invertible. Find the inverse.
Solution Consider an arbitrary element y of Y. By the definition of Y, y = 4x + 3,
for some x in the domain N . This shows that x =

( y − 3)
. Define g : Y → N by

Miscellaneous Examples
Example 18 If R1 and R2 are equivalence relations in a set A, show that R1 ∩ R2 is
also an equivalence relation.
Solution Since R1 and R2 are equivalence relations, (a, a) ∈ R1, and (a, a) ∈ R2 ∀ a ∈ A.
This implies that (a, a) ∈ R1 ∩ R2, ∀ a, showing R1 ∩ R2 is reflexive. Further,
(a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 ⇒ (a, b) ∈ R1 and (a, b) ∈ R2 ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R1 and (b, a) ∈ R2 ⇒
(b, a) ∈ R1 ∩ R2, hence, R1 ∩ R2 is symmetric. Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 and
(b, c) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R1 and (a, c) ∈ R2 ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R1 ∩ R2. This shows that
R1 ∩ R2 is transitive. Thus, R1 ∩ R2 is an equivalence relation.
Example 19 Let R be a relation on the set A of ordered pairs of positive integers
defined by (x, y) R (u, v) if and only if xv = yu. Show that R is an equivalence relation.
Solution Clearly, (x, y) R (x, y), ∀ (x, y) ∈ A, since xy = yx. This shows that R is
reflexive. Further, (x, y) R (u, v) ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ uy = vx and hence (u, v) R (x, y). This
shows that R is symmetric. Similarly, (x, y) R (u, v) and (u, v) R (a, b) ⇒ xv = yu and

b
a
a
a
= yu ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ xb = ya and hence (x, y) R (a, b). Thus, R

ub = va ⇒ xv

Example 20 Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let R1 be a relation in X given
by R1 = {(x, y) : x – y is divisible by 3} and R2 be another relation on X given by
R2 = {(x, y): {x, y} ⊂ {1, 4, 7}} or {x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8} or {x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9}}. Show that
R1 = R2.
Solution Note that the characteristic of sets {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8} and {3, 6, 9} is
that difference between any two elements of these sets is a multiple of 3. Therefore,
(x, y) ∈ R1 ⇒ x – y is a multiple of 3 ⇒ {x, y} ⊂ {1, 4, 7} or {x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8}
or {x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9} ⇒ (x, y) ∈ R2. Hence, R1 ⊂ R2. Similarly, {x, y} ∈ R2 ⇒ {x, y}

⊂ {1, 4, 7} or {x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8} or {x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9} ⇒ x – y is divisible by

Example 21 Let f : X → Y be a function. Define a relation R in X given by
R = {(a, b): f(a) = f(b)}. Examine whether R is an equivalence relation or not.
Solution For every a ∈ X, (a, a) ∈ R, since f (a) = f (a), showing that R is reflexive.
Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ f (a) = f (b) ⇒ f (b) = f (a) ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R. Therefore, R is
symmetric. Further, (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ f (a) = f (b) and f (b) = f (c) ⇒ f (a)
= f (c) ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R, which implies that R is transitive. Hence, R is an equivalence
relation.
Example 22 Find the number of all one-one functions from set A = {1, 2, 3} to itself.
Solution One-one function from {1, 2, 3} to itself is simply a permutation on three
symbols 1, 2, 3. Therefore, total number of one-one maps from {1, 2, 3} to itself is
same as total number of permutations on three symbols 1, 2, 3 which is 3! = 6.
Example 23 Let A = {1, 2, 3}. Then show that the number of relations containing (1, 2)
and (2, 3) which are reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is three.
Solution The smallest relation R1 containing (1, 2) and (2, 3) which is reflexive and
transitive but not symmetric is {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)}. Now, if we add
the pair (2, 1) to R1 to get R2, then the relation R2 will be reflexive, transitive but not
symmetric. Similarly, we can obtain R3 by adding (3, 2) to R1 to get the desired relation.
However, we can not add two pairs (2, 1), (3, 2) or single pair (3, 1) to R1 at a time, as
by doing so, we will be forced to add the remaining pair in order to maintain transitivity
and in the process, the relation will become symmetric also which is not required. Thus,
the total number of desired relations is three.
Example 24 Show that the number of equivalence relation in the set {1, 2, 3} containing
(1, 2) and (2, 1) is two.
Solution The smallest equivalence relation R1 containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is {(1, 1),
(2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1)}. Now we are left with only 4 pairs namely (2, 3), (3, 2),
(1, 3) and (3, 1). If we add any one, say (2, 3) to R1, then for symmetry we must add
(3, 2) also and now for transitivity we are forced to add (1, 3) and (3, 1). Thus, the only
equivalence relation bigger than R1 is the universal relation. This shows that the total
number of equivalence relations containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is two.
Example 25 Consider the identity function IN : N → N defined as IN (x) = x ∀ x ∈ N.
Show that although IN is onto but IN + IN : N → N defined as
(IN + IN) (x) = IN (x) + IN (x) = x + x = 2x is not onto.

Summary
In this chapter, we studied different types of relations and equivalence relation,
composition of functions, invertible functions and binary operations. The main features
of this chapter are as follows:
® Empty relation is the relation R in X given by R = φ ⊂ X × X.
® Universal relation is the relation R in X given by R = X × X.
® Reflexive relation R in X is a relation with (a, a) ∈ R ∀ a ∈ X.
® Symmetric relation R in X is a relation satisfying (a, b) ∈ R implies (b, a) ∈ R.
® Transitive relation R in X is a relation satisfying (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R
implies that (a, c) ∈ R.
® Equivalence relation R in X is a relation which is reflexive, symmetric and
transitive.
® Equivalence class [a] containing a ∈ X for an equivalence relation R in X is
the subset of X containing all elements b related to a.
® A function f : X → Y is one-one (or injective) if
f (x1) = f (x2) ⇒ x1 = x2 ∀ x1, x2 ∈ X.
® A function f : X → Y is onto (or surjective) if given any y ∈ Y, ∃ x ∈ X such
that f (x) = y.
® A function f : X → Y is one-one and onto (or bijective), if f is both one-one
and onto.
® Given a finite set X, a function f : X → X is one-one (respectively onto) if and
only if f is onto (respectively one-one). This is the characteristic property of a
finite set. This is not true for infinite set

RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS

Historical Note
The concept of function has evolved over a long period of time starting from
R. Descartes (1596-1650), who used the word ‘function’ in his manuscript
“Geometrie” in 1637 to mean some positive integral power xn of a variable x
while studying geometrical curves like hyperbola, parabola and ellipse. James
Gregory (1636-1675) in his work “ Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura”
(1667) considered function as a quantity obtained from other quantities by
successive use of algebraic operations or by any other operations. Later G. W.
Leibnitz (1646-1716) in his manuscript “Methodus tangentium inversa, seu de
functionibus” written in 1673 used the word ‘function’ to mean a quantity varying
from point to point on a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the
slope of the curve, the tangent and the normal to the curve at a point. However,
in his manuscript “Historia” (1714), Leibnitz used the word ‘function’ to mean
quantities that depend on a variable. He was the first to use the phrase ‘function
of x’. John Bernoulli (1667-1748) used the notation φx for the first time in 1718 to
indicate a function of x. But the general adoption of symbols like f, F, φ, ψ ... to
represent functions was made by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in 1734 in the first
part of his manuscript “Analysis Infinitorium”. Later on, Joeph Louis Lagrange
(1736-1813) published his manuscripts “Theorie des functions analytiques” in
1793, where he discussed about analytic function and used the notion f (x), F(x),
φ (x) etc. for different function of x. Subsequently, Lejeunne Dirichlet
(1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used till the set
theoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was
developed by Georg Cantor (1845-1918). The set theoretic definition of function
known to us presently is simply an abstraction of the definition given by Dirichlet
in a rigorous manner.

INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC
FUNCTIONS
v Mathematics, in general, is fundamentally the science of
self-evident things. — FELIX KLEIN v
2.1 Introduction
In Chapter 1, we have studied that the inverse of a function
f, denoted by f –1, exists if f is one-one and onto. There are
many functions which are not one-one, onto or both and
hence we can not talk of their inverses. In Class XI, we
studied that trigonometric functions are not one-one and
onto over their natural domains and ranges and hence their
inverses do not exist. In this chapter, we shall study about
the restrictions on domains and ranges of trigonometric
functions which ensure the existence of their inverses and
observe their behaviour through graphical representations.
Besides, some elementary properties will also be discussed.
Aryabhata
The inverse trigonometric functions play an important
(476-550 A. D.)
role in calculus for they serve to define many integrals.
The concepts of inverse trigonometric functions is also used in science and engineering.

2.2 Basic Concepts
In Class XI, we have studied trigonometric functions, which are defined as follows:
sine function, i.e., sine : R → [– 1, 1]
cosine function, i.e., cos : R → [– 1, 1]

π
, n ∈ Z} → R
2
cotangent function, i.e., cot : R – { x : x = nπ, n ∈ Z} → R
tangent function, i.e., tan : R – { x : x = (2n + 1)

π
, n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)
2
cosecant function, i.e., cosec : R – { x : x = nπ, n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)
secant function, i.e., sec : R – { x : x = (2n + 1)

We have also learnt in Chapter 1 that if f : X→Y such that f (x) = y is one-one and
onto, then we can define a unique function g : Y→X such that g (y) = x, where x ∈ X
and y = f (x), y ∈ Y. Here, the domain of g = range of f and the range of g = domain
of f. The function g is called the inverse of f and is denoted by f –1. Further, g is also
one-one and onto and inverse of g is f. Thus, g –1 = (f –1)–1 = f. We also have
(f –1 o f ) (x) = f –1 (f (x)) = f –1(y) = x
and
(f o f –1) (y) = f (f –1(y)) = f (x) = y
Since the domain of sine function is the set of all real numbers and range is the
−π π
closed interval [–1, 1]. If we restrict its domain to  ,  , then it becomes one-one
 2 2
and onto with range [– 1, 1]. Actually, sine function restricted to any of the intervals

 −3π π  ,  −π π  ,  π 3π  etc., is one-one and its range is [–1, 1]. We can,
 2 , 2   2 , 2   2 , 2 


therefore, define the inverse of sine function in each of these intervals. We denote the
inverse of sine function by sin–1 (arc sine function). Thus, sin–1 is a function whose
 −3π −π   −π π 
domain is [– 1, 1] and range could be any of the intervals 
,
or
,
,
2   2 2 
 2
 π 3π 
 2 , 2  , and so on. Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the


 −π π 
function sin–1. The branch with range  ,  is called the principal value branch,
 2 2
whereas other intervals as range give different branches of sin–1. When we refer
to the function sin–1, we take it as the function whose domain is [–1, 1] and range is
 −π π 
 −π π 
–1
 2 , 2  . We write sin : [–1, 1] →  2 , 2 




From the definition of the inverse functions, it follows that sin (sin–1 x) = x

π

if – 1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and sin–1 (sin x) = x if − ≤ x ≤ . In other words, if y = sin–1 x, then

sin y = x.
Remarks
(i) We know from Chapter 1, that if y = f (x) is an invertible function, then x = f –1 (y).
Thus, the graph of sin–1 function can be obtained from the graph of original
function by interchanging x and y axes, i.e., if (a, b) is a point on the graph of
sine function, then (b, a) becomes the corresponding point on the graph of inverse

of sine function. Thus, the graph of the function y = sin–1 x can be obtained from
the graph of y = sin x by interchanging x and y axes. The graphs of y = sin x and
y = sin–1 x are as given in Fig 2.1 (i), (ii), (iii). The dark portion of the graph of
y = sin–1 x represent the principal value branch.
(ii) It can be shown that the graph of an inverse function can be obtained from the
corresponding graph of original function as a mirror image (i.e., reflection) along
the line y = x. This can be visualised by looking the graphs of y = sin x and
y = sin–1 x as given in the same axes (Fig 2.1 (iii)).

Like sine function, the cosine function is a function whose domain is the set of all
real numbers and range is the set [–1, 1]. If we restrict the domain of cosine function
to [0, π], then it becomes one-one and onto with range [–1, 1]. Actually, cosine function

restricted to any of the intervals [– π, 0], [0,π], [π, 2π] etc., is bijective with range as
[–1, 1]. We can, therefore, define the inverse of cosine function in each of these
intervals. We denote the inverse of the cosine function by cos–1 (arc cosine function).
Thus, cos–1 is a function whose domain is [–1, 1] and range
could be any of the intervals [–π, 0], [0, π], [π, 2π] etc.
Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the
function cos–1. The branch with range [0, π] is called the principal
value branch of the function cos–1. We write
cos–1 : [–1, 1] → [0, π].
The graph of the function given by y = cos–1 x can be drawn
in the same way as discussed about the graph of y = sin–1 x. The
graphs of y = cos x and y = cos–1 x are given in Fig 2.2 (i) and (ii).

Fig 2.2 (i)

Let us now discuss cosec–1x and sec–1x as follows:
1
Since, cosec x =
, the domain of the cosec function is the set {x : x ∈ R and
sin x
x ≠ nπ, n ∈ Z} and the range is the set {y : y ∈ R, y ≥ 1 or y ≤ –1} i.e., the set
R – (–1, 1). It means that y = cosec x assumes all real values except –1 < y < 1 and is
not defined for integral multiple of π. If we restrict the domain of cosec function to
 π π
 − 2 , 2  – {0}, then it is one to one and onto with its range as the set R – (– 1, 1). Actually,

2.3 Properties of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
In this section, we shall prove some important properties of inverse trigonometric
functions. It may be mentioned here that these results are valid within the principal
value branches of the corresponding inverse trigonometric functions and wherever
they are defined. Some results may not be valid for all values of the domains of inverse
trigonometric functions. In fact, they will be valid only for some values of x for which
inverse trigonometric functions are defined. We will not go into the details of these
values of x in the domain as this discussion goes beyond the scope of this textbook.
Let us recall that if y = sin–1x, then x = sin y and if x = sin y, then y = sin–1x. This
is equivalent to

−π π
sin (sin–1 x) = x, x ∈ [– 1, 1] and sin–1 (sin x) = x, x ∈  , 
 2 2

For suitable values of domain similar results follow for remaining trigonometric
functions.

INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS

Historical Note
The study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian
Mathematicians, Aryabhata (476A.D.), Brahmagupta (598 A.D.), Bhaskara I
(600 A.D.) and Bhaskara II (1114 A.D.) got important results of trigonometry. All
this knowledge went from India to Arabia and then from there to Europe. The
Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so
clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted
throughout the world.
In India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as
the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents one of
the main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to
mathematics.
Bhaskara I (about 600 A.D.) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions
for angles more than 90°. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa
contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for sines or
cosines of 18°, 36°, 54°, 72°, etc., were given by Bhaskara II.
The symbols sin–1 x, cos–1 x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were suggested
by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The name of Thales
(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He
is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by
measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known
height, and comparing the ratios:

H h
= = tan (sun’s altitude)
S s
Thales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through
the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance
using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.

v The essence of Mathematics lies in its freedom. — CANTOR v
3.1 Introduction
The knowledge of matrices is necessary in various branches of mathematics. Matrices
are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This mathematical tool simplifies
our work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods. The
evolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and
simple methods of solving system of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as a
representation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices
far exceeds that use. Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet
programs for personal computer, which in turn is used in different areas of business
and science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an
experiment etc. Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and
reflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices. Matrices
are also used in cryptography. This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches
of sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology, modern psychology and industrial
management.
In this chapter, we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the
fundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra.

3.2 Matrix
Suppose we wish to express the information that Radha has 15 notebooks. We may
express it as [15] with the understanding that the number inside [ ] is the number of
notebooks that Radha has. Now, if we have to express that Radha has 15 notebooks
and 6 pens. We may express it as [15 6] with the understanding that first number
inside [ ] is the number of notebooks while the other one is the number of pens possessed
by Radha. Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possession

is as follows:

second column represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran,

respectively. Similarly, in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent
the number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. The
entries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia
and Simran, respectively. An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a
matrix. Formally, we define matrix as:
Definition 1 A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The
numbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix.
We denote matrices by capital letters. The following are some examples of matrices:

– 2

A= 0
3


1

2 + i 3 − 2 

1 + x


cos x sin x + 2 tan x 




5
6 
 3 5


7 

In the above examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows
of the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns of the
matrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2
rows and 3 columns.
3.2.1 Order of a matrix
A matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m × n or simply m × n
matrix (read as an m by n matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we
have A as 3 × 2 matrix, B as 3 × 3 matrix and C as 2 × 3 matrix. We observe that A has
3 × 2 = 6 elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively.
In general, an m × n matrix has the following rectangular array:

or A = [aij]m × n, 1≤ i ≤ m, 1≤ j ≤ n i, j ∈ N
Thus the ith row consists of the elements ai1, ai2, ai3,..., ain, while the jth column
consists of the elements a1j, a2j, a3j,..., amj ,
In general aij, is an element lying in the ith row and jth column. We can also call
it as the (i, j)th element of A. The number of elements in an m × n matrix will be
equal to mn.

ANote In this chapter
1. We shall follow the notation, namely A = [aij]m × n to indicate that A is a matrix
of order m × n.
2. We shall consider only those matrices whose elements are real numbers or
functions taking real values.
We can also represent any point (x, y) in a plane by a matrix (column or row) as
 x
 y  (or [x, y]). For example point P(0, 1) as a matrix representation may be given as
 

0
P =   or [0 1].
1 

Observe that in this way we can also express the vertices of a closed rectilinear
figure in the form of a matrix. For example, consider a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices
A (1, 0), B (3, 2), C (1, 3), D (–1, 2).
Now, quadrilateral ABCD in the matrix form, can be represented as
A B C D
1 3 1 −1
X=

B  3
Y=

D −1

Thus, matrices can be used as representation of vertices of geometrical figures in
a plane.
Now, let us consider some examples.

workers in three factories I, II and III

26 

The entry in the third row and second column represents the number of women
workers in factory III.
Example 2 If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have?
Solution We know that if a matrix is of order m × n, it has mn elements. Thus, to find
all possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural
numbers, whose product is 8.
Thus, all possible ordered pairs are (1, 8), (8, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4)
Hence, possible orders are 1 × 8, 8 ×1, 4 × 2, 2 × 4
Example 3 Construct a 3 × 2 matrix whose elements are given by aij =

3.3 Types of Matrices
In this section, we shall discuss different types of matrices.
(i) Column matrix
A matrix is said to be a column matrix if it has only one column.
 0 
 
 3
For example, A =  −1  is a column matrix of order 4 × 1.
 
1/ 2 

In general, A = [aij] m × 1 is a column matrix of order m × 1.
(ii) Row matrix
A matrix is said to be a row matrix if it has only one row.

 1
For example, B = −
 2


5 2 3 is a row matrix.
1× 4

In general, B = [bij] 1 × n is a row matrix of order 1 × n.
(iii) Square matrix
A matrix in which the number of rows are equal to the number of columns, is
said to be a square matrix. Thus an m × n matrix is said to be a square matrix if
m = n and is known as a square matrix of order ‘n’.
 3 −1
3

A

For example

In general, A = [aij] m × m is a square matrix of order m.

ANote If A = [a ] is a square matrix of order n, then elements (entries) a , a , ..., a

1 −3 1 

are said to constitute the diagonal, of the matrix A. Thus, if A = 2 4 −1 .
3 5 6 
Then the elements of the diagonal of A are 1, 4, 6.

MATHEMATICS

(iv) Diagonal matrix
A square matrix B = [bij] m × m is said to be a diagonal matrix if all its non
diagonal elements are zero, that is a matrix B = [bij] m × m is said to be a diagonal
matrix if bij = 0, when i ≠ j.

 −1.1 0 0

For example, A = [4], B = 
, C= 0

 0
0 3
of order 1, 2, 3, respectively.
(v) Scalar matrix
A diagonal matrix is said to be a scalar matrix if its diagonal elements are equal,
that is, a square matrix B = [bij] n × n is said to be a scalar matrix if
bij = 0, when i ≠ j
bij = k, when i = j, for some constant k.
For example

A = [3],

 −1 0 
B=

 3

C= 0

0

0
3


0

3

are scalar matrices of order 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
(vi) Identity matrix
A square matrix in which elements in the diagonal are all 1 and rest are all zero
is called an identity matrix. In other words, the square matrix A = [aij] n × n is an
1 if i = j
identity matrix, if aij = 
.
0 if i ≠ j
We denote the identity matrix of order n by In. When order is clear from the
context, we simply write it as I.

1 0 0 
1 0  0 1 0 
 are identity matrices of order 1, 2 and 3,
For example [1], 
, 
0 1  0 0 1 


respectively.
Observe that a scalar matrix is an identity matrix when k = 1. But every identity
matrix is clearly a scalar matrix.

(vii) Zero matrix
A matrix is said to be zero matrix or null matrix if all its elements are zero.
0 0  0 0 0 
For example, [0], 
, 
 , [0, 0] are all zero matrices. We denote
0 0  0 0 0 
zero matrix by O. Its order will be clear from the context.

3.3.1 Equality of matrices
Definition 2 Two matrices A = [aij] and B = [bij] are said to be equal if
(i) they are of the same order
(ii) each element of A is equal to the corresponding element of B, that is aij = bij for
all i and j.

Find the values of a, b, c, x, y and z.
Solution As the given matrices are equal, therefore, their corresponding elements
must be equal. Comparing the corresponding elements, we get
x + 3 = 0,
z + 4 = 6,
2y – 7 = 3y – 2
a – 1 = – 3,
0 = 2c + 2
b – 3 = 2b + 4,
Simplifying, we get
a = – 2, b = – 7, c = – 1, x = – 3, y = –5, z = 2

3.4 Operations on Matrices
In this section, we shall introduce certain operations on matrices, namely, addition of
matrices, multiplication of a matrix by a scalar, difference and multiplication of matrices.
3.4.1 Addition of matrices
Suppose Fatima has two factories at places A and B. Each factory produces sport
shoes for boys and girls in three different price categories labelled 1, 2 and 3. The
quantities produced by each factory are represented as matrices given below:

Suppose Fatima wants to know the total production of sport shoes in each price
category. Then the total production
In category 1 : for boys (80 + 90), for girls (60 + 50)
In category 2 : for boys (75 + 70), for girls (65 + 55)
In category 3 : for boys (90 + 75), for girls (85 + 75)

80 + 90
This can be represented in the matrix form as 75 + 70

This new matrix is the sum of the above two matrices. We observe that the sum of
two matrices is a matrix obtained by adding the corresponding elements of the given
matrices. Furthermore, the two matrices have to be of the same order.

a11 a12 a13 
b11 b12 b13 
Thus, if A = 
is a 2 × 3 matrix and B = 

b21 b22 b23 

2×3 matrix. Then, we define A + B = 
.
 a21 + b21 a22 + b22 a23 + b23 
In general, if A = [aij] and B = [bij] are two matrices of the same order, say m × n.
Then, the sum of the two matrices A and B is defined as a matrix C = [cij]m × n, where
cij = aij + bij, for all possible values of i and j.

2. We may observe that addition of matrices is an example of binary operation
on the set of matrices of the same order.
3.4.2 Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar
Now suppose that Fatima has doubled the production at a factory A in all categories
(refer to 3.4.1).

the new matrix is obtained by multiplying each element of the previous matrix by 2.
In general, we may define multiplication of a matrix by a scalar as follows: if
A = [aij] m × n is a matrix and k is a scalar, then kA is another matrix which is obtained
by multiplying each element of A by the scalar k.
In other words, kA = k [aij] m × n = [k (aij)] m × n, that is, (i, j)th element of kA is kaij
for all possible values of i and j.

Difference of matrices If A = [aij], B = [bij] are two matrices of the same order,
say m × n, then difference A – B is defined as a matrix D = [dij], where dij = aij – bij,
for all value of i and j. In other words, D = A – B = A + (–1) B, that is sum of the matrix
A and the matrix – B.

3.4.3 Properties of matrix addition
The addition of matrices satisfy the following properties:
(i) Commutative Law If A = [aij], B = [bij] are matrices of the same order, say
m × n, then A + B = B + A.
Now
A + B = [aij] + [bij] = [aij + bij]
= [bij + aij] (addition of numbers is commutative)
= ([bij] + [aij]) = B + A
(ii) Associative Law For any three matrices A = [aij], B = [bij], C = [cij] of the
same order, say m × n, (A + B) + C = A + (B + C).
Now
(A + B) + C = ([aij] + [bij]) + [cij]
= [aij + bij] + [cij] = [(aij + bij) + cij]
= [aij + (bij + cij)]
(Why?)
= [aij] + [(bij + cij)] = [aij] + ([bij] + [cij]) = A + (B + C)

(iii) Existence of additive identity Let A = [a ij] be an m × n matrix and
O be an m × n zero matrix, then A + O = O + A = A. In other words, O is the
additive identity for matrix addition.
(iv) The existence of additive inverse Let A = [aij]m × n be any matrix, then we
have another matrix as – A = [– aij]m × n such that A + (– A) = (– A) + A= O. So
– A is the additive inverse of A or negative of A.
3.4.4 Properties of scalar multiplication of a matrix
If A = [aij] and B = [bij] be two matrices of the same order, say m × n, and k and l are
scalars, then
(i) k(A +B) = k A + kB, (ii) (k + l)A = k A + l A
(ii) k (A + B) = k ([aij] + [bij])
= k [aij + bij] = [k (aij + bij)] = [(k aij) + (k bij)]
= [k aij] + [k bij] = k [aij] + k [bij] = kA + kB
(iii) ( k + l) A = (k + l) [aij]
= [(k + l) aij] + [k aij] + [l aij] = k [aij] + l [aij] = k A + l A

3.4.5 Multiplication of matrices
Suppose Meera and Nadeem are two friends. Meera wants to buy 2 pens and 5 story
books, while Nadeem needs 8 pens and 10 story books. They both go to a shop to
enquire about the rates which are quoted as follows:
Pen – ` 5 each, story book – ` 50 each.
How much money does each need to spend? Clearly, Meera needs ` (5 × 2 + 50 × 5)
that is ` 260, while Nadeem needs (8 × 5 + 50 × 10) `, that is ` 540. In terms of matrix
representation, we can write the above information as follows:

Suppose that they enquire about the rates from another shop, quoted as follows:
pen – ` 4 each, story book – ` 40 each.
Now, the money required by Meera and Nadeem to make purchases will be
respectively ` (4 × 2 + 40 × 5) = ` 208 and ` (8 × 4 + 10 × 40) = ` 432

The above is an example of multiplication of matrices. We observe that, for
multiplication of two matrices A and B, the number of columns in A should be equal to
the number of rows in B. Furthermore for getting the elements of the product matrix,
we take rows of A and columns of B, multiply them element-wise and take the sum.
Formally, we define multiplication of matrices as follows:
The product of two matrices A and B is defined if the number of columns of A is
equal to the number of rows of B. Let A = [aij] be an m × n matrix and B = [bjk] be an
n × p matrix. Then the product of the matrices A and B is the matrix C of order m × p.
To get the (i, k)th element cik of the matrix C, we take the ith row of A and kth column
of B, multiply them elementwise and take the sum of all these products. In other words,
if A = [aij]m × n, B = [bjk]n × p, then the ith row of A is [ai1 ai2 ... ain] and the kth column of

Remark If AB is defined, then BA need not be defined. In the above example, AB is
defined but BA is not defined because B has 3 column while A has only 2 (and not 3)
rows. If A, B are, respectively m × n, k × l matrices, then both AB and BA are defined
if and only if n = k and l = m. In particular, if both A and B are square matrices of the
same order, then both AB and BA are defined.
Non-commutativity of multiplication of matrices
Now, we shall see by an example that even if AB and BA are both defined, it is not
necessary that AB = BA.

In the above example both AB and BA are of different order and so AB ≠ BA. But
one may think that perhaps AB and BA could be the same if they were of the same
order. But it is not so, here we give an example to show that even if AB and BA are of
same order they may not be same.

Thus, if the product of two matrices is a zero matrix, it is not necessary that one of
the matrices is a zero matrix.

3.4.6 Properties of multiplication of matrices
The multiplication of matrices possesses the following properties, which we state without
proof.
1. The associative law For any three matrices A, B and C. We have
(AB) C = A (BC), whenever both sides of the equality are defined.
2. The distributive law For three matrices A, B and C.
(i) A (B+C) = AB + AC
(ii) (A+B) C = AC + BC, whenever both sides of equality are defined.
3. The existence of multiplicative identity For every square matrix A, there
exist an identity matrix of same order such that IA = AI = A.
Now, we shall verify these properties by examples.

In this section, we shall learn about transpose of a matrix and special types of matrices
such as symmetric and skew symmetric matrices.
Definition 3 If A = [aij] be an m × n matrix, then the matrix obtained by interchanging
the rows and columns of A is called the transpose of A. Transpose of the matrix A is
denoted by A′ or (AT). In other words, if A = [aij]m × n, then A′ = [aji]n × m. For example,

may be verified by taking suitable examples.
For any matrices A and B of suitable orders, we have

(ii) (kA)′ = kA′ (where k is any constant)
(iii) (A + B)′ = A′ + B′

Definition 5 A square matrix A = [aij] is said to be skew symmetric matrix if
A′ = – A, that is aji = – aij for all possible values of i and j. Now, if we put i = j, we
have aii = – aii. Therefore 2aii = 0 or aii = 0 for all i’s.
This means that all the diagonal elements of a skew symmetric matrix are zero.

Now, we are going to prove some results of symmetric and skew-symmetric
matrices.
Theorem 1 For any square matrix A with real number entries, A + A′ is a symmetric
matrix and A – A′ is a skew symmetric matrix.
Proof Let B = A + A′, then
B′ = (A + A′)′
= A′ + (A′)′ (as (A + B)′ = A′ + B′)
= A′ + A (as (A′)′ = A)
= A + A′ (as A + B = B + A)
= B
Therefore

B = A + A′ is a symmetric matrix

Now let

C = A – A′
C′ = (A – A′)′ = A′ – (A′)′
= A′ – A

(Why?)

(Why?)

= – (A – A′) = – C
Therefore

C = A – A′ is a skew symmetric matrix.

Theorem 2 Any square matrix can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a
skew symmetric matrix.
Proof Let A be a square matrix, then we can write

A = (A + A′) + (A − A′)

From the Theorem 1, we know that (A + A′) is a symmetric matrix and (A – A′) is
a skew symmetric matrix. Since for any matrix A, (kA)′ = kA′, it follows that

Definition 6 If A is a square matrix of order m, and if there exists another square
matrix B of the same order m, such that AB = BA = I, then B is called the inverse
matrix of A and it is denoted by A– 1. In that case A is said to be invertible.
For example, let

A Note
1. A rectangular matrix does not possess inverse matrix, since for products BA
and AB to be defined and to be equal, it is necessary that matrices A and B
should be square matrices of the same order.
2. If B is the inverse of A, then A is also the inverse of B.
Theorem 3 (Uniqueness of inverse) Inverse of a square matrix, if it exists, is unique.
Proof Let A = [aij] be a square matrix of order m. If possible, let B and C be two
inverses of A. We shall show that B = C.
Since B is the inverse of A
AB = BA = I

... (1)

AC = CA = I

... (2)

Since C is also the inverse of A
Thus
B = BI = B (AC) = (BA) C = IC = C
Theorem 4 If A and B are invertible matrices of the same order, then (AB)–1 = B–1 A–1.
Proof From the definition of inverse of a matrix, we have
(AB) (AB)–1 = 1
or

A–1 (AB) (AB)–1 = A –1 I

(Pre multiplying both sides by A–1)

or

(A–1A) B (AB)–1 = A –1

(Since A–1 I = A–1)

or

IB (AB)–1 = A –1

or

B (AB)–1 = A –1

or

B–1 B (AB)–1 = B –1 A–1

or

I (AB)–1 = B –1 A–1

Hence

(AB)–1 = B –1 A–1

DETERMINANTS
v All Mathematical truths are relative and conditional. — C.P. STEINMETZ v
4.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter, we have studied about matrices
and algebra of matrices. We have also learnt that a system
of algebraic equations can be expressed in the form of
matrices. This means, a system of linear equations like
a1 x + b1 y = c 1
a2 x + b2 y = c 2
a b   x c 
can be represented as  1 1    =  1  . Now, this
 a2 b2   y  c2 
system of equations has a unique solution or not, is
determined by the number a1 b2 – a2 b1. (Recall that if

a1 b1
or, a1 b2 – a2 b1 ≠ 0, then the system of linear
≠
a2 b2
equations has a unique solution). The number a1 b2 – a2 b1

P.S. Laplace
(1749-1827)

a b 
which determines uniqueness of solution is associated with the matrix A =  1 1 
 a2 b2 
and is called the determinant of A or det A. Determinants have wide applications in
Engineering, Science, Economics, Social Science, etc.
In this chapter, we shall study determinants up to order three only with real entries.
Also, we will study various properties of determinants, minors, cofactors and applications
of determinants in finding the area of a triangle, adjoint and inverse of a square matrix,
consistency and inconsistency of system of linear equations and solution of linear
equations in two or three variables using inverse of a matrix.

4.2 Determinant
To every square matrix A = [aij] of order n, we can associate a number (real or
complex) called determinant of the square matrix A, where aij = (i, j)th element of A.

This may be thought of as a function which associates each square matrix with a
unique number (real or complex). If M is the set of square matrices, K is the set of
numbers (real or complex) and f : M → K is defined by f (A) = k, where A ∈ M and
k ∈ K, then f (A) is called the determinant of A. It is also denoted by | A | or det A or ∆.

If A = 

Remarks
(i) For matrix A, | A | is read as determinant of A and not modulus of A.
(ii) Only square matrices have determinants.

4.2.3 Determinant of a matrix of order 3 × 3
Determinant of a matrix of order three can be determined by expressing it in terms of
second order determinants. This is known as expansion of a determinant along
a row (or a column). There are six ways of expanding a determinant of order

Expansion along first Row (R1)
Step 1 Multiply first element a11 of R1 by (–1)(1 + 1) [(–1)sum of suffixes in a11] and with the

Step 2 Multiply 2nd element a12 of R1 by (–1)1 + 2 [(–1)sum of suffixes in a12] and the second

of | A | as a12 lies in R1 and C2,

Step 3 Multiply third element a13 of R1 by (–1)1 + 3 [(–1)sum of suffixes in a ] and the second

reader to verify that the values of |A| by expanding along R3, C2 and C3 are equal to the
value of | A | obtained in (1), (2) or (3).
Hence, expanding a determinant along any row or column gives same value.
Remarks
(i) For easier calculations, we shall expand the determinant along that row or column
which contains maximum number of zeros.
(ii) While expanding, instead of multiplying by (–1)i + j, we can multiply by +1 or –1
according as (i + j) is even or odd.

calculation.

4.4 Minors and Cofactors
In this section, we will learn to write the expansion of a determinant in compact form
using minors and cofactors.
Definition 1 Minor of an element aij of a determinant is the determinant obtained by
deleting its ith row and jth column in which element aij lies. Minor of an element aij is
denoted by Mij.
Remark Minor of an element of a determinant of order n(n ≥ 2) is a determinant of
order n – 1.
1 2 3
Example 8 Find the minor of element 6 in the determinant ∆ = 4 5 6

Solution Since 6 lies in the second row and third column, its minor M23 is given by
M23 =

1 2
= 8 – 14 = – 6 (obtained by deleting R2 and C3 in ∆).
7 8

Definition 2 Cofactor of an element aij , denoted by Aij is defined by
Aij = (–1)i + j Mij , where Mij is minor of aij .
Example 9 Find minors and cofactors of all the elements of the determinant

Solution Minor of the element aij is Mij
Here a11 = 1. So M11 = Minor of a11= 3
M12 = Minor of the element a12 = 4
M21 = Minor of the element a21 = –2
M22 = Minor of the element a22 = 1
Now, cofactor of aij is Aij. So
A11 = (–1)1 + 1 M11 = (–1)2 (3) = 3
A12 = (–1)1 + 2 M12 = (–1)3 (4) = – 4
A21 = (–1)2 + 1 M21 = (–1)3 (–2) = 2
A22 = (–1)2 + 2 M22 = (–1)4 (1) = 1

= sum of product of elements of R1 with their corresponding cofactors
Similarly, ∆ can be calculated by other five ways of expansion that is along R2, R3,
C1, C2 and C3.
Hence ∆ = sum of the product of elements of any row (or column) with their
corresponding cofactors.
Note If elements of a row (or column) are multiplied with cofactors of any
A
other row (or column), then their sum is zero. For example,
∆ = a11 A21 + a12 A22 + a13 A23

In the previous chapter, we have studied inverse of a matrix. In this section, we shall

To find inverse of a matrix A, i.e., A–1 we shall first define adjoint of a matrix.

Definition 3 The adjoint of a square matrix A = [aij]n × n is defined as the transpose of
the matrix [Aij]n × n, where Aij is the cofactor of the element aij . Adjoint of the matrix A

(Why?)

i.e.
|(adj A)| |A| = | A |3 (1)
i.e.
|(adj A)| = | A | 2
In general, if A is a square matrix of order n, then | adj (A) | = | A |n – 1.
Theorem 4 A square matrix A is invertible if and only if A is nonsingular matrix.
Proof Let A be invertible matrix of order n and I be the identity matrix of order n.
Then, there exists a square matrix B of order n such that AB = BA = I
Now

AB = I. So AB = I

or

A B =1

This gives

A ≠ 0. Hence A is nonsingular.

(since I =1, AB = A B )

Conversely, let A be nonsingular. Then A ≠ 0
Now

A (adj A) = (adj A) A = A I

4.6 Applications of Determinants and Matrices
In this section, we shall discuss application of determinants and matrices for solving the
system of linear equations in two or three variables and for checking the consistency of
the system of linear equations.

MATHEMATICS

Consistent system A system of equations is said to be consistent if its solution (one
or more) exists.
Inconsistent system A system of equations is said to be inconsistent if its solution
does not exist.
Note In this chapter, we restrict ourselves to the system of linear equations
A
having unique solutions only.
4.6.1 Solution of system of linear equations using inverse of a matrix
Let us express the system of linear equations as matrix equations and solve them using
inverse of the coefficient matrix.
Consider the system of equations
a1 x + b1 y + c 1 z = d1
a2 x + b2 y + c 2 z = d 2
a3 x + b3 y + c 3 z = d 3
Let

 a1




c2  , X =  y  and B =  d 2 
 z 
 d3 
c3 

Then, the system of equations can be written as, AX = B, i.e.,
 a1

 2
 a3

c1   x 
 d1 



c2   y  =  d 2 
 d3 
c3   z 

Case I If A is a nonsingular matrix, then its inverse exists. Now
AX = B
A–1 (AX) = A–1 B
(premultiplying by A–1)
–1
–1
(A A) X = A B
(by associative property)
–1
IX=A B
X = A–1 B
This matrix equation provides unique solution for the given system of equations as
inverse of a matrix is unique. This method of solving system of equations is known as
Matrix Method.
Case II If A is a singular matrix, then | A | = 0.
In this case, we calculate (adj A) B.
If (adj A) B ≠ O, (O being zero matrix), then solution does not exist and the
system of equations is called inconsistent.

If (adj A) B = O, then system may be either consistent or inconsistent according
as the system have either infinitely many solutions or no solution.
Example 16 Solve the system of equations
2x + 5y = 1
3x + 2y = 7
Solution The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where
2 5
x
1 
, X =   and B =  
A= 

3 2
 y
7 

Now, A = –11 ≠ 0, Hence, A is nonsingular matrix and so has a unique solution.
A–1 = −

Note that

Hence

Example 17 Solve the following system of equations by matrix method.
3x – 2y + 3z = 8
2x + y – z = 1
4x – 3y + 2z = 4
Solution The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where
 3 −2 3 
 x

A =  2 1 −1 , X =  y  and B = 1 
 4 −3 2 
 z 
 4

We see that
A = 3 (2 – 3) + 2(4 + 4) + 3 (– 6 – 4) = – 17 ≠ 0

Hence, A is nonsingular and so its inverse exists. Now
A11 = –1,
A12 = – 8,
A21 = –5,
A22 = – 6,
A31 = –1,
A32 = 9,

A13 = –10

Example 18 The sum of three numbers is 6. If we multiply third number by 3 and add
second number to it, we get 11. By adding first and third numbers, we get double of the
second number. Represent it algebraically and find the numbers using matrix method.
Solution Let first, second and third numbers be denoted by x, y and z, respectively.
Then, according to given conditions, we have
x+y+z=6
y + 3z = 11
x + z = 2y or x – 2y + z = 0

A21 = – (1 + 2) = – 3,
A31 = (3 – 1) = 2,
Hence

A12 = – (0 – 3) = 3,

Historical Note
The Chinese method of representing the coefficients of the unknowns of
several linear equations by using rods on a calculating board naturally led to the
discovery of simple method of elimination. The arrangement of rods was precisely
that of the numbers in a determinant. The Chinese, therefore, early developed the
idea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant
Mikami, China, pp 30, 93.
Seki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth
century in his work ‘Kai Fukudai no Ho’ in 1683 showed that he had the idea of
determinants and of their expansion. But he used this device only in eliminating a
quantity from two equations and not directly in the solution of a set of simultaneous
linear equations. T. Hayashi, “The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese
Mathematics,” in the proc. of the Tokyo Math. Soc., V.
Vendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions.
He may be called the formal founder. Laplace (1772), gave general method of
expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors. In 1773 Lagrange
treated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose
other than the solution of equations. In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his
theory of numbers.
The next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who
stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m-columns and nrows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem.
Also on the same day, Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject. He
used the word ‘determinant’ in its present sense. He gave the proof of multiplication
theorem more satisfactory than Binet’s.
The greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after
this the word determinant received its final acceptance.

CONTINUITY AND
DIFFERENTIABILITY
v The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement
of everyday thinking.” — ALBERT EINSTEIN v
5.1 Introduction
This chapter is essentially a continuation of our study of
differentiation of functions in Class XI. We had learnt to
differentiate certain functions like polynomial functions and
trigonometric functions. In this chapter, we introduce the
very important concepts of continuity, differentiability and
relations between them. We will also learn differentiation
of inverse trigonometric functions. Further, we introduce a
new class of functions called exponential and logarithmic
functions. These functions lead to powerful techniques of
differentiation. We illustrate certain geometrically obvious
conditions through differential calculus. In the process, we
will learn some fundamental theorems in this area.
Sir Issac Newton
(1642-1727)

5.2 Continuity

We start the section with two informal examples to get a feel of continuity. Consider
the function
1, if x ≤ 0
f ( x) = 
2, if x > 0

This function is of course defined at every
point of the real line. Graph of this function is
given in the Fig 5.1. One can deduce from the
graph that the value of the function at nearby
points on x-axis remain close to each other
except at x = 0. At the points near and to the
left of 0, i.e., at points like – 0.1, – 0.01, – 0.001,
the value of the function is 1. At the points near
and to the right of 0, i.e., at points like 0.1, 0.01,

CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY

105

0.001, the value of the function is 2. Using the language of left and right hand limits, we
may say that the left (respectively right) hand limit of f at 0 is 1 (respectively 2). In
particular the left and right hand limits do not coincide. We also observe that the value
of the function at x = 0 concides with the left hand limit. Note that when we try to draw
the graph, we cannot draw it in one stroke, i.e., without lifting pen from the plane of the
paper, we can not draw the graph of this function. In fact, we need to lift the pen when
we come to 0 from left. This is one instance of function being not continuous at x = 0.
Now, consider the function defined as
1, if x ≠ 0
f ( x) = 
2, if x = 0

This function is also defined at every point. Left and the right hand limits at x = 0
are both equal to 1. But the value of the
function at x = 0 equals 2 which does not
coincide with the common value of the left
and right hand limits. Again, we note that we
cannot draw the graph of the function without
lifting the pen. This is yet another instance of
a function being not continuous at x = 0.
Naively, we may say that a function is
continuous at a fixed point if we can draw the
graph of the function around that point without
lifting the pen from the plane of the paper.

Fig 5.2

Mathematically, it may be phrased precisely as follows:
Definition 1 Suppose f is a real function on a subset of the real numbers and let c be
a point in the domain of f. Then f is continuous at c if
lim f ( x ) = f (c )
x→ c

More elaborately, if the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function
at x = c exist and equal to each other, then f is said to be continuous at x = c. Recall that
if the right hand and left hand limits at x = c coincide, then we say that the common
value is the limit of the function at x = c. Hence we may also rephrase the definition of
continuity as follows: a function is continuous at x = c if the function is defined at
x = c and if the value of the function at x = c equals the limit of the function at
x = c. If f is not continuous at c, we say f is discontinuous at c and c is called a point
of discontinuity of f.

MATHEMATICS

Example 1 Check the continuity of the function f given by f (x) = 2x + 3 at x = 1.
Solution First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 1 and its value is 5.
Then find the limit of the function at x = 1. Clearly
lim f ( x ) = lim (2 x + 3) = 2(1) + 3 = 5
x →1

Thus

x →1

lim f ( x ) = 5 = f (1)
x →1

Hence, f is continuous at x = 1.
Example 2 Examine whether the function f given by f (x) = x2 is continuous at x = 0.
Solution First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 0 and its value is 0.
Then find the limit of the function at x = 0. Clearly
lim f ( x) = lim x 2 = 02 = 0
x→ 0

Thus

x→ 0

lim f ( x ) = 0 = f (0)
x→ 0

Hence, f is continuous at x = 0.
Example 3 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f(x) = | x | at x = 0.
Solution By definition
 − x, if x < 0
f (x) = 
 x, if x ≥ 0
Clearly the function is defined at 0 and f (0) = 0. Left hand limit of f at 0 is

lim f ( x) = lim− (– x) = 0

x→ 0 −

x→ 0

Similarly, the right hand limit of f at 0 is

lim f ( x) = lim+ x = 0

x → 0+

x→ 0

Thus, the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function coincide at
x = 0. Hence, f is continuous at x = 0.
Example 4 Show that the function f given by
3
 x + 3, if x ≠ 0
f (x) = 
if x = 0
1,

is not continuous at x = 0.

CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY

107

Solution The function is defined at x = 0 and its value at x = 0 is 1. When x ≠ 0, the
function is given by a polynomial. Hence,
lim f ( x ) = lim ( x3 + 3) = 03 + 3 = 3
x→ 0

x→0

Since the limit of f at x = 0 does not coincide with f (0), the function is not continuous
at x = 0. It may be noted that x = 0 is the only point of discontinuity for this function.
Example 5 Check the points where the constant function f (x) = k is continuous.
Solution The function is defined at all real numbers and by definition, its value at any
real number equals k. Let c be any real number. Then
lim f ( x ) = lim k = k
x→ c

x→ c

Since f (c) = k = lim
x → c f (x) for any real number c, the function f is continuous at
every real number.
Example 6 Prove that the identity function on real numbers given by f (x) = x is
continuous at every real number.
Solution The function is clearly defined at every point and f (c) = c for every real
number c. Also,
lim f ( x) = lim x = c
x→c

x→ c

Thus, lim f (x) = c = f (c) and hence the function is continuous at every real number.
x→ c

Having defined continuity of a function at a given point, now we make a natural
extension of this definition to discuss continuity of a function.
Definition 2 A real function f is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point
in the domain of f.
This definition requires a bit of elaboration. Suppose f is a function defined on a
closed interval [a, b], then for f to be continuous, it needs to be continuous at every
point in [a, b] including the end points a and b. Continuity of f at a means

lim f ( x) = f (a)

x→ a+

and continuity of f at b means

lim f ( x) = f(b)

x→b –

Observe that lim− f ( x) and lim+ f ( x) do not make sense. As a consequence
x→ a

x→b

of this definition, if f is defined only at one point, it is continuous there, i.e., if the
domain of f is a singleton, f is a continuous function.

Example 7 Is the function defined by f (x) = | x |, a continuous function?
Solution We may rewrite f as
 − x, if x < 0
f (x) = 
 x, if x ≥ 0
By Example 3, we know that f is continuous at x = 0.

Let c be a real number such that c < 0. Then f (c) = – c. Also
lim f ( x ) = lim ( − x ) = – c
x→ c

x→c

(Why?)

Since lim f ( x) = f (c) , f is continuous at all negative real numbers.
x→ c

Now, let c be a real number such that c > 0. Then f (c) = c. Also
lim f ( x ) = lim x = c
x→ c

x→ c

(Why?)

Since lim f ( x) = f (c) , f is continuous at all positive real numbers. Hence, f
x→ c

is continuous at all points.
Example 8 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f (x) = x3 + x2 – 1.
Solution Clearly f is defined at every real number c and its value at c is c3 + c2 – 1. We
also know that
lim f ( x ) = lim ( x3 + x 2 − 1) = c3 + c 2 − 1
x→c

x→ c

Thus lim f ( x ) = f (c ) , and hence f is continuous at every real number. This means
x→ c

f is a continuous function.

We take this opportunity to explain the concept of infinity. This we do by analysing
1
the function f (x) = near x = 0. To carry out this analysis we follow the usual trick of
x
finding the value of the function at real numbers close to 0. Essentially we are trying to
find the right hand limit of f at 0. We tabulate this in the following (Table 5.1).

We observe that as x gets closer to 0 from the right, the value of f (x) shoots up
higher. This may be rephrased as: the value of f (x) may be made larger than any given
number by choosing a positive real number very close to 0. In symbols, we write

lim f ( x) = + ∞

x → 0+

(to be read as: the right hand limit of f (x) at 0 is plus infinity). We wish to emphasise
that + ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the right hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as
a real number).
Similarly, the left hand limit of f at 0 may be found. The following table is self
explanatory.

From the Table 5.2, we deduce that the
value of f (x) may be made smaller than any
given number by choosing a negative real
number very close to 0. In symbols,
we write

lim f ( x) = − ∞

x → 0−

(to be read as: the left hand limit of f (x) at 0 is
minus infinity). Again, we wish to emphasise
that – ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the
left hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as a real
number). The graph of the reciprocal function
given in Fig 5.3 is a geometric representation
of the above mentioned facts.

MATHEMATICS

Example 10 Discuss the continuity of the function f defined by
 x + 2, if x ≤ 1
f (x) = 
 x − 2, if x > 1

Solution The function f is defined at all points of the real line.
Case 1 If c < 1, then f (c) = c + 2. Therefore, lim f ( x ) = lim( x + 2) = c + 2
x→ c

x→c

Thus, f is continuous at all real numbers less than 1.
Case 2 If c > 1, then f (c) = c – 2. Therefore,
lim f ( x) = lim (x – 2) = c – 2 = f (c)
x →c

x →c

Thus, f is continuous at all points x > 1.
Case 3 If c = 1, then the left hand limit of f at
x = 1 is
lim f ( x) = lim– ( x + 2) = 1 + 2 = 3

x →1–

x →1

The right hand limit of f at x = 1 is
lim f ( x) = lim+ ( x − 2) = 1 − 2 = −1

x→1+

x →1

Since the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1
Fig 5.4
do not coincide, f is not continuous at x = 1. Hence
x = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f. The graph of the function is given in Fig 5.4.
Example 11 Find all the points of discontinuity of the function f defined by
 x + 2, if x < 1

f (x) =  0, if x = 1
 x − 2, if x > 1

Solution As in the previous example we find that f
is continuous at all real numbers x ≠ 1. The left
hand limit of f at x = 1 is
lim− f ( x) = lim– ( x + 2) = 1 + 2 = 3
x →1

x →1

The right hand limit of f at x = 1 is
lim+ f ( x) = lim+ ( x − 2) = 1 − 2 = −1
x→1

x →1

Since, the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1
do not coincide, f is not continuous at x = 1. Hence
x = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f. The
graph of the function is given in the Fig 5.5.

Example 12 Discuss the continuity of the function defined by
 x + 2, if x < 0
f (x) = 
 − x + 2, if x > 0

Solution Observe that the function is defined at all real numbers except at 0. Domain
of definition of this function is
D1 ∪ D2 where D1 = {x ∈ R : x < 0} and
D2 = {x ∈ R : x > 0}
Case 1 If c ∈ D 1, then lim f ( x) = lim (x + 2)
x →c

x →c

= c + 2 = f (c) and hence f is continuous in D1.
Case 2 If c ∈ D2, then lim f ( x) = lim (– x + 2)
x →c

x →c

= – c + 2 = f (c) and hence f is continuous in D2.
Since f is continuous at all points in the domain of f,
we deduce that f is continuous. Graph of this
function is given in the Fig 5.6. Note that to graph
Fig 5.6
this function we need to lift the pen from the plane
of the paper, but we need to do that only for those points where the function is not
defined.
Example 13 Discuss the continuity of the function f given by
 x, if x ≥ 0
f (x) =  2
 x , if x < 0

Solution Clearly the function is defined at
every real number. Graph of the function is
given in Fig 5.7. By inspection, it seems prudent
to partition the domain of definition of f into
three disjoint subsets of the real line.
Let

D1 = {x ∈ R : x < 0}, D2 = {0} and
D3 = {x ∈ R : x > 0}

Fig 5.7

Case 1 At any point in D1, we have f (x) = x2 and it is easy to see that it is continuous
there (see Example 2).
Case 2 At any point in D3, we have f (x) = x and it is easy to see that it is continuous
there (see Example 6).

MATHEMATICS

Case 3 Now we analyse the function at x = 0. The value of the function at 0 is f (0) = 0.
The left hand limit of f at 0 is

lim f ( x) = lim− x 2 = 02 = 0

x →0 –

x →0

The right hand limit of f at 0 is
lim f ( x) = lim+ x = 0

x → 0+

x →0

Thus lim f ( x) = 0 = f (0) and hence f is continuous at 0. This means that f is
x →0

continuous at every point in its domain and hence, f is a continuous function.
Example 14 Show that every polynomial function is continuous.
Solution Recall that a function p is a polynomial function if it is defined by
p(x) = a0 + a1 x + ... + an xn for some natural number n, an ≠ 0 and ai ∈ R. Clearly this
function is defined for every real number. For a fixed real number c, we have
lim p ( x) = p (c)
x →c

By definition, p is continuous at c. Since c is any real number, p is continuous at
every real number and hence p is a continuous function.
Example 15 Find all the points of discontinuity of the greatest integer function defined
by f (x) = [x], where [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
Solution First observe that f is defined for all real numbers. Graph of the function is
given in Fig 5.8. From the graph it looks like that f is discontinuous at every integral
point. Below we explore, if this is true.

Case 1 Let c be a real number which is not equal to any integer. It is evident from the
graph that for all real numbers close to c the value of the function is equal to [c]; i.e.,
lim f ( x) = lim [ x] = [c] . Also f (c) = [c] and hence the function is continuous at all real
x →c

x →c

numbers not equal to integers.
Case 2 Let c be an integer. Then we can find a sufficiently small real number
r > 0 such that [c – r] = c – 1 whereas [c + r] = c.
This, in terms of limits mean that
lim f (x) = c – 1, lim+ f (x) = c

x →c −

x →c

Since these limits cannot be equal to each other for any c, the function is
discontinuous at every integral point.
5.2.1 Algebra of continuous functions
In the previous class, after having understood the concept of limits, we learnt some
algebra of limits. Analogously, now we will study some algebra of continuous functions.
Since continuity of a function at a point is entirely dictated by the limit of the function at
that point, it is reasonable to expect results analogous to the case of limits.
Theorem 1 Suppose f and g be two real functions continuous at a real number c.
Then
(1) f + g is continuous at x = c.
(2) f – g is continuous at x = c.
(3) f . g is continuous at x = c.
 f 
(4)   is continuous at x = c, (provided g (c) ≠ 0).

Proof We are investigating continuity of (f + g) at x = c. Clearly it is defined at
x = c. We have
lim( f + g ) ( x ) = lim [ f ( x) + g ( x)]

Remarks
(i) As a special case of (3) above, if f is a constant function, i.e., f (x) = λ for some
real number λ, then the function (λ . g) defined by (λ . g) (x) = λ . g(x) is also
continuous. In particular if λ = – 1, the continuity of f implies continuity of – f.
(ii) As a special case of (4) above, if f is the constant function f (x) = λ, then the

The above theorem can be exploited to generate many continuous functions. They
also aid in deciding if certain functions are continuous or not. The following examples
illustrate this:

Example 16 Prove that every rational function is continuous.
Solution Recall that every rational function f is given by

p ( x)
, q ( x) ≠ 0
q( x)
where p and q are polynomial functions. The domain of f is all real numbers except
points at which q is zero. Since polynomial functions are continuous (Example 14), f is
continuous by (4) of Theorem 1.
f ( x) =

Example 17 Discuss the continuity of sine function.
Solution To see this we use the following facts
lim sin x = 0
x →0

We have not proved it, but is intuitively clear from the graph of sin x near 0.
Now, observe that f (x) = sin x is defined for every real number. Let c be a real
number. Put x = c + h. If x → c we know that h → 0. Therefore
lim f ( x) = lim sin x
x →c

x→c

sin(c + h)

[sin c cos h + cos c sin h]

[sin c cos h] + lim [cos c sin h]

Thus lim f (x) = f (c) and hence f is a continuous function.

Remark A similar proof may be given for the continuity of cosine function.
Example 18 Prove that the function defined by f (x) = tan x is a continuous function.
Solution The function f (x) = tan x =

sin x
. This is defined for all real numbers such
cos x

π
. We have just proved that both sine and cosine
2
functions are continuous. Thus tan x being a quotient of two continuous functions is
continuous wherever it is defined.
An interesting fact is the behaviour of continuous functions with respect to
composition of functions. Recall that if f and g are two real functions, then
(f o g) (x) = f (g (x))
is defined whenever the range of g is a subset of domain of f. The following theorem
(stated without proof) captures the continuity of composite functions.
Theorem 2 Suppose f and g are real valued functions such that (f o g) is defined at c.
If g is continuous at c and if f is continuous at g (c), then (f o g) is continuous at c.
The following examples illustrate this theorem.
that cos x ≠ 0, i.e., x ≠ (2n +1)

Example 19 Show that the function defined by f (x) = sin (x2) is a continuous function.
Solution Observe that the function is defined for every real number. The function
f may be thought of as a composition g o h of the two functions g and h, where
g (x) = sin x and h (x) = x2. Since both g and h are continuous functions, by Theorem 2,
it can be deduced that f is a continuous function.
Example 20 Show that the function f defined by
f (x) = |1 – x + | x | |,
where x is any real number, is a continuous function.
Solution Define g by g (x) = 1 – x + | x | and h by h (x) = | x | for all real x. Then
(h o g) (x) = h (g (x))
= h (1– x + | x |)
= | 1– x + | x | | = f (x)
In Example 7, we have seen that h is a continuous function. Hence g being a sum
of a polynomial function and the modulus function is continuous. But then f being a
composite of two continuous functions is continuous.

Suppose f is a real function and c is a point in its domain. The derivative of f at c is
defined by

derivative of a function is called differentiation. We also use the phrase differentiate
f (x) with respect to x to mean find f ′(x).
The following rules were established as a part of algebra of derivatives:
(1) (u ± v)′ = u′ ± v′
(2) (uv)′ = u′v + uv′ (Leibnitz or product rule)
denoted by f ′ (x) or

Now the natural question is; what if it doesn’t? The question is quite pertinent and so is

at a and b respectively. Similarly, a function is said to be differentiable in an interval
(a, b) if it is differentiable at every point of (a, b).

Corollary 1 Every differentiable function is continuous.
We remark that the converse of the above statement is not true. Indeed we have
seen that the function defined by f (x) = | x | is a continuous function. Consider the left

5.3.1 Derivatives of composite functions
To study derivative of composite functions, we start with an illustrative example. Say,
we want to find the derivative of f, where
f (x) = (2x + 1)3

a polynomial function as illustrated below.

d
(8 x 3 + 12 x 2 + 6 x + 1)

= 24x2 + 24x + 6
= 6 (2x + 1)2
Now, observe that
f (x) = (h o g) (x)
where g(x) = 2x + 1 and h(x) = x3. Put t = g(x) = 2x + 1. Then f(x) = h(t) = t3. Thus

The advantage with such observation is that it simplifies the calculation in finding
the derivative of, say, (2x + 1)100. We may formalise this observation in the following
theorem called the chain rule.
Theorem 4 (Chain Rule) Let f be a real valued function which is a composite of two
functions u and v ; i.e., f = v o u. Suppose t = u (x) and if both

We skip the proof of this theorem. Chain rule may be extended as follows. Suppose
f is a real valued function which is a composite of three functions u, v and w ; i.e.,

Example 21 Find the derivative of the function given by f (x) = sin (x2).
Solution Observe that the given function is a composite of two functions. Indeed, if
t = u(x) = x2 and v(t) = sin t, then
f (x) = (v o u) (x) = v(u(x)) = v(x2) = sin x2

5.3.2 Derivatives of implicit functions
Until now we have been differentiating various functions given in the form y = f (x).
But it is not necessary that functions are always expressed in this form. For example,
consider one of the following relationships between x and y:
x–y–π=0
x + sin xy – y = 0
In the first case, we can solve for y and rewrite the relationship as y = x – π. In
the second case, it does not seem that there is an easy way to solve for y. Nevertheless,
there is no doubt about the dependence of y on x in either of the cases. When a
relationship between x and y is expressed in a way that it is easy to solve for y and
write y = f (x), we say that y is given as an explicit function of x. In the latter case it

not prove this. Now we use chain rule to find derivatives of these functions.

5.4 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
Till now we have learnt some aspects of different classes of functions like polynomial
functions, rational functions and trigonometric functions. In this section, we shall
learn about a new class of (related) functions called exponential functions and logarithmic
functions. It needs to be emphasized that many statements made in this section are
motivational and precise proofs of these are well beyond the scope of this text.
The Fig 5.9 gives a sketch of y = f1(x) = x, y = f2(x) = x2, y = f3(x) = x3 and y = f4(x)
= x . Observe that the curves get steeper as the power of x increases. Steeper the
curve, faster is the rate of growth. What this means is that for a fixed increment in the
value of x (> 1), the increment in the value of y = fn (x) increases as n increases for n
= 1, 2, 3, 4. It is conceivable that such a statement is true for all positive values of n,
4

Rationalised 2023-24

126

MATHEMATICS

where fn (x) = xn. Essentially, this means
that the graph of y = fn (x) leans more
towards the y-axis as n increases. For
example, consider f10(x) = x10 and f15(x)
= x 15 . If x increases from 1 to 2, f 10
increases from 1 to 2 10 whereas f 15
increases from 1 to 215. Thus, for the same
increment in x, f15 grow faster than f10.
Upshot of the above discussion is that
the growth of polynomial functions is
dependent on the degree of the polynomial
function – higher the degree, greater is
Fig 5.9
the growth. The next natural question is:
Is there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function. The answer is in
affirmative and an example of such a function is
y = f (x) = 10x.
Our claim is that this function f grows faster than fn (x) = xn for any positive integer n.
For example, we can prove that 10x grows faster than f100 (x) = x100. For large values
3

of x like x = 103, note that f100 (x) = (103)100 = 10300 whereas f (103) = 1010 = 101000.
Clearly f (x) is much greater than f100 (x). It is not difficult to prove that for all
x > 103, f (x) > f100 (x). But we will not attempt to give a proof of this here. Similarly, by
choosing large values of x, one can verify that f (x) grows faster than fn (x) for any
positive integer n.
Definition 3 The exponential function with positive base b > 1 is the function
y = f (x) = bx
The graph of y = 10x is given in the Fig 5.9.
It is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of b like 2, 3 and 4.
Following are some of the salient features of the exponential functions:
(1) Domain of the exponential function is R, the set of all real numbers.
(2) Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.
(3) The point (0, 1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a
restatement of the fact that b0 = 1 for any real b > 1).
(4) Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e., as we move from left to right, the
graph rises above.

(5) For very large negative values of x, the exponential function is very close to 0. In
other words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches x-axis (but never
meets it).
Exponential function with base 10 is called the common exponential function. In
the Appendix A.1.4 of Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series

1 1
+ + ...
1! 2!
is a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by e. Using this e as the base we obtain an
extremely important exponential function y = ex.
This is called natural exponential function.
It would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and
has nice interpretation. This search motivates the following definition.
1+

Definition 4 Let b > 1 be a real number. Then we say logarithm of a to base b is x if
bx = a.
Logarithm of a to base b is denoted by logb a. Thus logb a = x if bx = a. Let us
work with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this. We know 23 = 8. In terms of
logarithms, we may rewrite this as log2 8 = 3. Similarly, 104 = 10000 is equivalent to
saying log10 10000 = 4. Also, 625 = 54 = 252 is equivalent to saying log5 625 = 4 or
log25 625 = 2.
On a slightly more mature note, fixing a base b > 1, we may look at logarithm as
a function from positive real numbers to all real numbers. This function, called the
logarithmic function, is defined by
logb : R+ → R
x → logb x = y if by = x
As before if the base b = 10, we say it
is common logarithms and if b = e, then
we say it is natural logarithms. Often
natural logarithm is denoted by ln. In this
chapter, log x denotes the logarithm
function to base e, i.e., ln x will be written
as simply log x. The Fig 5.10 gives the plots
of logarithm function to base 2, e and 10.
Some of the important observations
about the logarithm function to any base
b > 1 are listed below:

MATHEMATICS

(1) We cannot make a meaningful definition of logarithm of non-positive numbers
and hence the domain of log function is R+.
(2) The range of log function is the set of all real numbers.
(3) The point (1, 0) is always on the graph of the log function.
(4) The log function is ever increasing,
i.e., as we move from left to right
the graph rises above.
(5) For x very near to zero, the value
of log x can be made lesser than
any given real number. In other
words in the fourth quadrant the
graph approaches y-axis (but
never meets it).
(6) Fig 5.11 gives the plot of y = ex and
y = ln x. It is of interest to observe
that the two curves are the mirror
images of each other reflected in the line y = x.

Fig 5.11

Two properties of ‘log’ functions are proved below:
(1) There is a standard change of base rule to obtain loga p in terms of logb p. Let
loga p = α, logb p = β and logb a = γ. This means aα = p, bβ = p and bγ = a.
Substituting the third equation in the first one, we have
(bγ)α = bγα = p
Using this in the second equation, we get
bβ = p = bγα
which implies

β = αγ or α =

loga p =

β
. But then
γ

log b p
log b a

(2) Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products. Let
logb pq = α. Then bα = pq. If logb p = β and logb q = γ, then bβ = p and bγ = q.
But then bα = pq = bβbγ = bβ + γ
which implies α = β + γ, i.e.,
logb pq = logb p + logb q

129

A particularly interesting and important consequence of this is when p = q. In
this case the above may be rewritten as
logb p2 = logb p + logb p = 2 log p
An easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is
logb pn = n log p
for any positive integer n. In fact this is true for any real number n, but we will
not attempt to prove this. On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify

log b

x
= logb x – logb y
y

Example 25 Is it true that x = elog x for all real x?
Solution First, observe that the domain of log function is set of all positive real numbers.
So the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers. Now, let y = elog x. If
y > 0, we may take logarithm which gives us log y = log (elog x) = log x . log e = log x. Thus
y = x. Hence x = elog x is true only for positive values of x.
One of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential
calculus is that it doesn’t change during the process of differentiation. This is captured
in the following theorem whose proof we skip.

5.5. Logarithmic Differentiation
In this section, we will learn to differentiate certain special class of functions given in
the form
y = f (x) = [u(x)]v (x)
By taking logarithm (to base e) the above may be rewritten as
log y = v(x) log [u(x)]
Using chain rule we may differentiate this to get

u′(x) + v′(x) . log [u(x)]

positive as otherwise their logarithms are not defined. This process of differentiation is
known as logarithms differentiation and is illustrated by the following examples:

5.6 Derivatives of Functions in Parametric Forms
Sometimes the relation between two variables is neither explicit nor implicit, but some
link of a third variable with each of the two variables, separately, establishes a relation
between the first two variables. In such a situation, we say that the relation between

precisely, a relation expressed between two variables x and y in the form
x = f (t), y = g (t) is said to be parametric form with t as a parameter.

Summary

® A real valued function is continuous at a point in its domain if the limit of the
function at that point equals the value of the function at that point. A function
is continuous if it is continuous on the whole of its domain.

® Sum, difference, product and quotient of continuous functions are continuous.
i.e., if f and g are continuous functions, then
(f ± g) (x) = f (x) ± g (x) is continuous.
(f . g) (x) = f (x) . g (x) is continuous.
f ( x)
 f 
 g  ( x) = g ( x) (wherever g (x) ≠ 0) is continuous.
 

® Every differentiable function is continuous, but the converse is not true.

APPLICATION OF
DERIVATIVES
v With the Calculus as a key, Mathematics can be successfully applied
to the explanation of the course of Nature.” — WHITEHEAD v
6.1 Introduction
In Chapter 5, we have learnt how to find derivative of composite functions, inverse
trigonometric functions, implicit functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions.
In this chapter, we will study applications of the derivative in various disciplines, e.g., in
engineering, science, social science, and many other fields. For instance, we will learn
how the derivative can be used (i) to determine rate of change of quantities, (ii) to find
the equations of tangent and normal to a curve at a point, (iii) to find turning points on
the graph of a function which in turn will help us to locate points at which largest or
smallest value (locally) of a function occurs. We will also use derivative to find intervals
on which a function is increasing or decreasing. Finally, we use the derivative to find
approximate value of certain quantities.

6.2 Rate of Change of Quantities

respect to the time t. In a similar fashion, whenever one quantity y varies with another

dy 
change of y with respect to x and dx 
(or f ′(x0)) represents the rate of change
x = x0
of y with respect to x at x = x0 .
Further, if two variables x and y are varying with respect to another variable t, i.e.,
if x = f (t ) and y = g (t ) , then by Chain Rule

Thus, the rate of change of y with respect to x can be calculated using the rate of
change of y and that of x both with respect to t.
Let us consider some examples.
Example 1 Find the rate of change of the area of a circle per second with respect to
its radius r when r = 5 cm.
Solution The area A of a circle with radius r is given by A = πr2. Therefore, the rate
of change of the area A with respect to its radius r is given by
When r = 5 cm,

dA d
= ( π r 2 ) = 2π r .
dr dr

dA
= 10π . Thus, the area of the circle is changing at the rate of
dr

10π cm2/s.
Example 2 The volume of a cube is increasing at a rate of 9 cubic centimetres per
second. How fast is the surface area increasing when the length of an edge is 10
centimetres ?
Solution Let x be the length of a side, V be the volume and S be the surface area of
the cube. Then, V = x3 and S = 6x2, where x is a function of time t.

of 4cm per second. At the instant, when the radius of the circular wave is 10 cm, how

as x increases.
Example 4 The length x of a rectangle is decreasing at the rate of 3 cm/minute and
the width y is increasing at the rate of 2cm/minute. When x =10cm and y = 6cm, find
the rates of change of (a) the perimeter and (b) the area of the rectangle.
Solution Since the length x is decreasing and the width y is increasing with respect to
time, we have

Example 5 The total cost C(x) in Rupees, associated with the production of x units of
an item is given by
C (x) = 0.005 x3 – 0.02 x2 + 30x + 5000
Find the marginal cost when 3 units are produced, where by marginal cost we
mean the instantaneous rate of change of total cost at any level of output.
Solution Since marginal cost is the rate of change of total cost with respect to the
output, we have

dC

Solution Since marginal revenue is the rate of change of total revenue with respect to
the number of units sold, we have

6.3 Increasing and Decreasing Functions

decreasing or none.

as we move from left to right, the
height of the graph increases

as we move from left to right, the
height of the graph decreases

Fig 6.1
First consider the graph (Fig 6.1) to the right of the origin. Observe that as we
move from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously increases.
For this reason, the function is said to be increasing for the real numbers x > 0.
Now consider the graph to the left of the origin and observe here that as we move
from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously decreases.
Consequently, the function is said to be decreasing for the real numbers x < 0.
We shall now give the following analytical definitions for a function which is
increasing or decreasing on an interval.
Definition 1 Let I be an interval contained in the domain of a real valued function f.
Then f is said to be
(i) increasing on I if x1 < x2 in I ⇒ f (x1) < f (x2) for all x1, x2 ∈ I.
(ii) decreasing on I, if x1, x2 in I ⇒ f (x1) < f (x2) for all x1, x2 ∈ I.
(iii) constant on I, if f(x) = c for all x ∈ I, where c is a constant.

(iv) decreasing on I if x1 < x2 in I ⇒ f (x1) ≥ f (x2) for all x1, x2 ∈ I.
(v) strictly decreasing on I if x1 < x2 in I ⇒ f (x1) > f (x2) for all x1, x2 ∈ I.
For graphical representation of such functions see Fig 6.2.

(iii)

Fig 6.2
We shall now define when a function is increasing or decreasing at a point.
Definition 2 Let x0 be a point in the domain of definition of a real valued function f.
Then f is said to be increasing, decreasing at x0 if there exists an open interval I
containing x0 such that f is increasing, decreasing, respectively, in I.
Let us clarify this definition for the case of increasing function.
Example 7 Show that the function given by f (x) = 7x – 3 is increasing on R.
Solution Let x1 and x2 be any two numbers in R. Then
x1 < x2 ⇒ 7x1 < 7x2 ⇒ 7x1 – 3 < 7x2 – 3 ⇒ f (x1) < f (x2)
Thus, by Definition 1, it follows that f is strictly increasing on R.
We shall now give the first derivative test for increasing and decreasing functions.
The proof of this test requires the Mean Value Theorem studied in Chapter 5.
Theorem 1 Let f be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval
(a,b). Then

MATHEMATICS

Proof (a) Let x1, x2 ∈ [a, b] be such that x1 < x2.
Then, by Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 8 in Chapter 5), there exists a point c
between x1 and x2 such that
f (x2) – f (x1) = f ′(c) (x2 – x1)
i.e.

f (x2) – f (x1) > 0

i.e.
Thus, we have

f (x2) > f (x 1)
x1 < x2

f ( x1 )

(as f ′(c) > 0 (given))

f ( x2 ), for all x1 , x2 [ a, b ]

Hence, f is an increasing function in [a,b].
The proofs of part (b) and (c) are similar. It is left as an exercise to the reader.
Remarks
There is a more generalised theorem, which states that if f¢(x) > 0 for x in an interval
excluding the end points and f is continuous in the interval, then f is increasing. Similarly,
if f¢(x) < 0 for x in an interval excluding the end points and f is continuous in the
interval, then f is decreasing.
Example 8 Show that the function f given by
f (x) = x3 – 3x2 + 4x, x ∈ R
is increasing on R.
Solution Note that
f ′(x) = 3x2 – 6x + 4
= 3(x2 – 2x + 1) + 1
= 3(x – 1)2 + 1 > 0, in every interval of R
Therefore, the function f is increasing on R.
Example 9 Prove that the function given by f (x) = cos x is
(a) decreasing in (0, π)
(b) increasing in (π, 2π), and
(c) neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2π).

Solution Note that f ′(x) = – sin x
(a) Since for each x ∈ (0, π), sin x > 0, we have f ′(x) < 0 and so f is decreasing in
(0, π).
(b) Since for each x ∈ (π, 2π), sin x < 0, we have f ′(x) > 0 and so f is increasing in
(π, 2π).
(c) Clearly by (a) and (b) above, f is neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2π).
Example 10 Find the intervals in which the function f given by f (x) = x2 – 4x + 6 is
(a) increasing

(b) decreasing

Solution We have
f (x) = x2 – 4x + 6
or
f ′(x) = 2x – 4

Fig 6.3

Therefore, f ′(x) = 0 gives x = 2. Now the point x = 2 divides the real line into two
disjoint intervals namely, (– ∞, 2) and (2, ∞) (Fig 6.3). In the interval (– ∞, 2), f ′(x) = 2x
– 4 < 0.
Therefore, f is decreasing in this interval. Also, in the interval (2, ∞) , f ′ ( x) > 0
and so the function f is increasing in this interval.
Example 11 Find the intervals in which the function f given by f (x) = 4x3 – 6x2 – 72x
+ 30 is (a) increasing (b) decreasing.
Solution We have
f (x) = 4x3 – 6x2 – 72x + 30
or

f ′(x) = 12x2 – 12x – 72
= 12(x2 – x – 6)
= 12(x – 3) (x + 2)

Therefore, f ′(x) = 0 gives x = – 2, 3. The
points x = – 2 and x = 3 divides the real line into
three disjoint intervals, namely, (– ∞, – 2), (– 2, 3)
and (3, ∞).

6.4 Maxima and Minima
In this section, we will use the concept of derivatives to calculate the maximum or
minimum values of various functions. In fact, we will find the ‘turning points’ of the
graph of a function and thus find points at which the graph reaches its highest (or

lowest) locally. The knowledge of such points is very useful in sketching the graph of
a given function. Further, we will also find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum
of a function that are necessary for the solution of many applied problems.
Let us consider the following problems that arise in day to day life.
(i) The profit from a grove of orange trees is given by P(x) = ax + bx2, where a,b
are constants and x is the number of orange trees per acre. How many trees per
acre will maximise the profit?
(ii) A ball, thrown into the air from a building 60 metres high, travels along a path
x2
, where x is the horizontal distance from the building
60
and h(x) is the height of the ball . What is the maximum height the ball will
reach?
(iii) An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the path given by the curve
f (x) = x2 + 7. A soldier, placed at the point (1, 2), wants to shoot the helicopter
when it is nearest to him. What is the nearest distance?
In each of the above problem, there is something common, i.e., we wish to find out
the maximum or minimum values of the given functions. In order to tackle such problems,
we first formally define maximum or minimum values of a function, points of local
maxima and minima and test for determining such points.
Definition 3 Let f be a function defined on an interval I. Then
(a) f is said to have a maximum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that
f (c) > f ( x ) , for all x ∈ I.

given by h( x ) = 60 + x −

The number f (c) is called the maximum value of f in I and the point c is called a
point of maximum value of f in I.
(b) f is said to have a minimum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that
f (c) < f (x), for all x ∈ I.
The number f (c), in this case, is called the minimum value of f in I and the point
c, in this case, is called a point of minimum value of f in I.
(c) f is said to have an extreme value in I if there exists a point c in I such that
f (c) is either a maximum value or a minimum value of f in I.
The number f (c), in this case, is called an extreme value of f in I and the point c
is called an extreme point.
Remark In Fig 6.7(a), (b) and (c), we have exhibited that graphs of certain particular
functions help us to find maximum value and minimum value at a point. Infact, through
graphs, we can even find maximum/minimum value of a function at a point at which it
is not even differentiable (Example 15).

Example 14 Find the maximum and the minimum values, if
any, of the function f given by
f (x) = x2, x ∈ R.
Solution From the graph of the given function (Fig 6.8), we
have f (x) = 0 if x = 0. Also
f (x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R.
Therefore, the minimum value of f is 0 and the point of
minimum value of f is x = 0. Further, it may be observed
from the graph of the function that f has no maximum value
and hence no point of maximum value of f in R.

Note If we restrict the domain of f to [– 2, 1] only,
then f will have maximum value(– 2)2 = 4 at x = – 2.

Therefore, the function f has a minimum value 0
and the point of minimum value of f is x = 0. Also, the
graph clearly shows that f has no maximum value in R
and hence no point of maximum value in R.

(ii) One may note that the function f in Example 27 is not differentiable at
x = 0.
Example 16 Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any, of the function
given by
f (x) = x, x ∈ (0, 1).
Solution The given function is an increasing (strictly) function in the given interval
(0, 1). From the graph (Fig 6.10) of the function f , it
seems that, it should have the minimum value at a
point closest to 0 on its right and the maximum value
at a point closest to 1 on its left. Are such points
available? Of course, not. It is not possible to locate
such points. Infact, if a point x0 is closest to 0, then
we find

x0
< x0 for all x0 ∈ (0,1) . Also, if x1 is closest

Fig 6.10

Remark The reader may observe that in Example 16, if we include the points 0 and 1
in the domain of f , i.e., if we extend the domain of f to [0,1], then the function f has
minimum value 0 at x = 0 and maximum value 1 at x = 1. Infact, we have the following
results (The proof of these results are beyond the scope of the present text)
Every monotonic function assumes its maximum/minimum value at the end
points of the domain of definition of the function.
A more general result is
Every continuous function on a closed interval has a maximum and a minimum
value.
Note By a monotonic function f in an interval I, we mean that f is either
A
increasing in I or decreasing in I.
Maximum and minimum values of a function defined on a closed interval will be
discussed later in this section.
Let us now examine the graph of a function as shown in Fig 6.11. Observe that at
points A, B, C and D on the graph, the function changes its nature from decreasing to
increasing or vice-versa. These points may be called turning points of the given
function. Further, observe that at turning points, the graph has either a little hill or a little
valley. Roughly speaking, the function has minimum value in some neighbourhood
(interval) of each of the points A and C which are at the bottom of their respective

valleys. Similarly, the function has maximum value in some neighbourhood of points B
and D which are at the top of their respective hills. For this reason, the points A and C
may be regarded as points of local minimum value (or relative minimum value) and
points B and D may be regarded as points of local maximum value (or relative maximum
value) for the function. The local maximum value and local minimum value of the
function are referred to as local maxima and local minima, respectively, of the function.
We now formally give the following definition
Definition 4 Let f be a real valued function and let c be an interior point in the domain
of f. Then
(a) c is called a point of local maxima if there is an h > 0 such that
f (c) ≥ f (x), for all x in (c – h, c + h), x ≠ c
The value f (c) is called the local maximum value of f.
(b) c is called a point of local minima if there is an h > 0 such that
f (c) ≤ f (x), for all x in (c – h, c + h)
The value f (c) is called the local minimum value of f .
Geometrically, the above definition states that if x = c is a point of local maxima of f,
then the graph of f around c will be as shown in Fig 6.12(a). Note that the function f is
increasing (i.e., f ′(x) > 0) in the interval (c – h, c) and decreasing (i.e., f ′(x) < 0) in the
interval (c, c + h).
This suggests that f ′(c) must be zero.

Fig 6.12

164

MATHEMATICS

Similarly, if c is a point of local minima of f , then the graph of f around c will be as
shown in Fig 6.14(b). Here f is decreasing (i.e., f ′(x) < 0) in the interval (c – h, c) and
increasing (i.e., f ′(x) > 0) in the interval (c, c + h). This again suggest that f ′(c) must
be zero.
The above discussion lead us to the following theorem (without proof).
Theorem 2 Let f be a function defined on an open interval I. Suppose c ∈ I be any
point. If f has a local maxima or a local minima at x = c, then either f ′(c) = 0 or f is not
differentiable at c.
Remark The converse of above theorem need not
be true, that is, a point at which the derivative vanishes
need not be a point of local maxima or local minima.
For example, if f (x) = x3, then f ′(x) = 3x2 and so
f ′(0) = 0. But 0 is neither a point of local maxima nor
a point of local minima (Fig 6.13).

ANote A point c in the domain of a function f at

which either f ′(c) = 0 or f is not differentiable is
called a critical point of f. Note that if f is continuous
at c and f ′(c) = 0, then there exists an h > 0 such
that f is differentiable in the interval
(c – h, c + h).

Fig 6.13

We shall now give a working rule for finding points of local maxima or points of
local minima using only the first order derivatives.
Theorem 3 (First Derivative Test) Let f be a function defined on an open interval I.
Let f be continuous at a critical point c in I. Then
(i) If f ′(x) changes sign from positive to negative as x increases through c, i.e., if
f ′(x) > 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c, and f ′(x) < 0 at
every point sufficiently close to and to the right of c, then c is a point of local
maxima.
(ii) If f ′(x) changes sign from negative to positive as x increases through c, i.e., if
f ′(x) < 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c, and f ′(x) > 0 at
every point sufficiently close to and to the right of c, then c is a point of local
minima.
(iii) If f ′(x) does not change sign as x increases through c, then c is neither a point of
local maxima nor a point of local minima. Infact, such a point is called point of
inflection (Fig 6.13).

ANote If c is a point of local maxima of f , then f (c) is a local maximum value of
f. Similarly, if c is a point of local minima of f , then f(c) is a local minimum value of f.
Figures 6.13 and 6.14, geometrically explain Theorem 3.

Fig 6.14

Example 17 Find all points of local maxima and local minima of the function f
given by
f (x) = x3 – 3x + 3.
Solution We have
f (x) = x3 – 3x + 3
or
f ′(x) = 3x2 – 3 = 3 (x – 1) (x + 1)
or
f ′(x) = 0 at x = 1 and x = – 1
Thus, x = ± 1 are the only critical points which could possibly be the points of local
maxima and/or local minima of f . Let us first examine the point x = 1.
Note that for values close to 1 and to the right of 1, f ′(x) > 0 and for values close
to 1 and to the left of 1, f ′(x) < 0. Therefore, by first derivative test, x = 1 is a point
of local minima and local minimum value is f (1) = 1. In the case of x = –1, note that
f ′(x) > 0, for values close to and to the left of –1 and f ′(x) < 0, for values close to and
to the right of – 1. Therefore, by first derivative test, x = – 1 is a point of local maxima
and local maximum value is f (–1) = 5.

Example 18 Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function f
given by
f (x) = 2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5.
Solution We have
or
or

f (x) = 2x3 – 6x2 + 6x + 5
f ′(x) = 6x2 – 12x + 6 = 6 (x – 1)2
f ′(x) = 0 at x = 1

Thus, x = 1 is the only critical point of f . We shall now examine this point for local
maxima and/or local minima of f. Observe that f ′(x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R and in particular
f ′(x) > 0, for values close to 1 and to the left and to the right of 1. Therefore, by first
derivative test, the point x = 1 is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local
minima. Hence x = 1 is a point of inflexion.
Remark One may note that since f ′(x), in Example 30, never changes its sign on R,
graph of f has no turning points and hence no point of local maxima or local minima.
We shall now give another test to examine local maxima and local minima of a
given function. This test is often easier to apply than the first derivative test.
Theorem 4 (Second Derivative Test) Let f be a function defined on an interval I
and c ∈ I. Let f be twice differentiable at c. Then
(i) x = c is a point of local maxima if f ′(c) = 0 and f ″(c) < 0
The value f (c) is local maximum value of f .
(ii) x = c is a point of local minima if f ′ (c) = 0 and f ″(c) > 0
In this case, f (c) is local minimum value of f .
(iii) The test fails if f ′(c) = 0 and f ″(c) = 0.
In this case, we go back to the first derivative test and find whether c is a point of
local maxima, local minima or a point of inflexion.
Note As f is twice differentiable at c, we mean
A
second order derivative of f exists at c.

given by f (x) = 3 + | x |, x ∈ R.
Solution Note that the given function is not differentiable
at x = 0. So, second derivative test fails. Let us try first
derivative test. Note that 0 is a critical point of f . Now to
the left of 0, f (x) = 3 – x and so f ′(x) = – 1 < 0. Also to

the right of 0, f (x) = 3 + x and so f ′(x) = 1 > 0. Therefore, by first derivative test, x =
0 is a point of local minima of f and local minimum value of f is f (0) = 3.

Solution We have
or
or
Now

f (x) = 3x4 + 4x3 – 12x2 + 12
f ′(x) = 12x3 + 12x2 – 24x = 12x (x – 1) (x + 2)
f ′(x) = 0 at x = 0, x = 1 and x = – 2.
f ″(x) = 36x2 + 24x – 24 = 12 (3x2 + 2x – 2)
 f ′′ (0) = −24 < 0

 f ′′ (1) = 36 > 0
 f ′′ ( −2) = 72 > 0


or

Therefore, by second derivative test, x = 0 is a point of local maxima and local
maximum value of f at x = 0 is f (0) = 12 while x = 1 and x = – 2 are the points of local
minima and local minimum values of f at x = – 1 and – 2 are f (1) = 7 and f (–2) = –20,
respectively.
Example 21 Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function f
given by
f (x) = 2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5.
Solution We have
f (x) = 2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5
or

 f ′( x) = 6 x 2 − 12 x + 6 = 6( x − 1) 2

 f ′′( x) = 12( x − 1)

Now f ′(x) = 0 gives x =1. Also f ″(1) = 0. Therefore, the second derivative test
fails in this case. So, we shall go back to the first derivative test.
We have already seen (Example 18) that, using first derivative test, x =1 is neither
a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima and so it is a point of inflexion.

Example 24 Let AP and BQ be two vertical poles at
points A and B, respectively. If AP = 16 m, BQ = 22 m
and AB = 20 m, then find the distance of a point R on
AB from the point A such that RP2 + RQ2 is minimum.
Solution Let R be a point on AB such that AR = x m.
Then RB = (20 – x) m (as AB = 20 m). From Fig 6.16,
we have
RP2 = AR2 + AP2

and
RQ2 = RB2 + BQ2

Therefore
RP + RQ = AR + AP + RB + BQ

= 2x2 – 40x + 1140
Let
S ≡ S(x) = RP2 + RQ2 = 2x2 – 40x + 1140.
Therefore
S′(x) = 4x – 40.
Now S′(x) = 0 gives x = 10. Also S″(x) = 4 > 0, for all x and so S″(10) > 0.
Therefore, by second derivative test, x = 10 is the point of local minima of S. Thus, the
distance of R from A on AB is AR = x =10 m.

6.4.1 Maximum and Minimum Values of a Function in a Closed Interval
Let us consider a function f given by
f (x) = x + 2, x ∈ (0, 1)
Observe that the function is continuous on (0, 1) and neither has a maximum value
nor has a minimum value. Further, we may note that the function even has neither a
local maximum value nor a local minimum value.
However, if we extend the domain of f to the closed interval [0, 1], then f still may
not have a local maximum (minimum) values but it certainly does have maximum value
3 = f (1) and minimum value 2 = f (0). The maximum value 3 of f at x = 1 is called
absolute maximum value (global maximum or greatest value) of f on the interval
[0, 1]. Similarly, the minimum value 2 of f at x = 0 is called the absolute minimum
value (global minimum or least value) of f on [0, 1].
Consider the graph given in Fig 6.19 of a continuous function defined on a closed
interval [a, d]. Observe that the function f has a local minima at x = b and local

MATHEMATICS

Fig 6.19

minimum value is f (b). The function also has a local maxima at x = c and local maximum
value is f (c).
Also from the graph, it is evident that f has absolute maximum value f (a) and
absolute minimum value f (d). Further note that the absolute maximum (minimum)
value of f is different from local maximum (minimum) value of f .
We will now state two results (without proof) regarding absolute maximum and
absolute minimum values of a function on a closed interval I.
Theorem 5 Let f be a continuous function on an interval I = [a, b]. Then f has the
absolute maximum value and f attains it at least once in I. Also, f has the absolute
minimum value and attains it at least once in I.
Theorem 6 Let f be a differentiable function on a closed interval I and let c be any
interior point of I. Then
(i) f ′(c) = 0 if f attains its absolute maximum value at c.
(ii) f ′(c) = 0 if f attains its absolute minimum value at c.
In view of the above results, we have the following working rule for finding absolute
maximum and/or absolute minimum values of a function in a given closed interval
[a, b].
Working Rule
Step 1: Find all critical points of f in the interval, i.e., find points x where either
f ′ ( x) = 0 or f is not differentiable.
Step 2: Take the end points of the interval.
Step 3: At all these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of f .
Step 4: Identify the maximum and minimum values of f out of the values calculated in
Step 3. This maximum value will be the absolute maximum (greatest) value of
f and the minimum value will be the absolute minimum (least) value of f .

Example 27 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a function f given by
f (x) = 2x3 – 15x2 + 36x +1 on the interval [1, 5].
Solution We have
f (x) = 2x3 – 15x2 + 36x + 1
or
f ′(x) = 6x2 – 30x + 36 = 6 (x – 3) (x – 2)
Note that f ′(x) = 0 gives x = 2 and x = 3.
We shall now evaluate the value of f at these points and at the end points of the
interval [1, 5], i.e., at x = 1, x = 2, x = 3 and at x = 5. So
f (1) = 2 (13) – 15 (12) + 36 (1) + 1 = 24
f (2) = 2 (23) – 15 (22) + 36 (2) + 1 = 29
f (3) = 2 (33) – 15 (32) + 36 (3) + 1 = 28
f (5) = 2 (53) – 15 (52) + 36 (5) + 1 = 56
Thus, we conclude that absolute maximum value of f on [1, 5] is 56, occurring at
x =5, and absolute minimum value of f on [1, 5] is 24 which occurs at x = 1.

Example 29 An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the curve given by
y = x2 + 7. A soldier, placed at (3, 7), wants to shoot down the helicopter when it is
nearest to him. Find the nearest distance.
Solution For each value of x, the helicopter’s position is at point (x, x 2 + 7).
Therefore, the distance between the helicopter and the soldier placed at (3,7) is
( x − 3) 2 + ( x 2 + 7 − 7) 2 , i.e.,

( x − 3) 2 + x 4 .

f (x) = (x – 3)2 + x4
f ′(x) = 2(x – 3) + 4x3 = 2 (x – 1) (2x2 + 2x + 3)
Thus, f ′(x) = 0 gives x = 1 or 2x2 + 2x + 3 = 0 for which there are no real roots.
Also, there are no end points of the interval to be added to the set for which f ′ is zero,
i.e., there is only one point, namely, x = 1. The value of f at this point is given by
f (1) = (1 – 3)2 + (1)4 = 5. Thus, the distance between the solider and the helicopter is

Let

f (1) = 5 .

Note that

5 is either a maximum value or a minimum value. Since

5 is the minimum value of

MATHEMATICS

Now f ′(x) = 0 gives x = 1, x = – 2, or x = 3. The
points x = 1, – 2, and 3 divide the real line into four
disjoint intervals namely, (– ∞, – 2), (– 2, 1), (1, 3)
and (3, ∞) (Fig 6.22).

Fig 6.22

Consider the interval (– ∞, – 2), i.e., when – ∞ < x < – 2.
In this case, we have x – 1 < 0, x + 2 < 0 and x – 3 < 0.
(In particular, observe that for x = –3, f ′(x) = (x – 1) (x + 2) (x – 3) = (– 4) (– 1)
(– 6) < 0)
Therefore,

f ′(x) < 0 when – ∞ < x < – 2.

Thus, the function f is decreasing in (– ∞, – 2).
Consider the interval (– 2, 1), i.e., when – 2 < x < 1.
In this case, we have x – 1 < 0, x + 2 > 0 and x – 3 < 0
(In particular, observe that for x = 0, f ′(x) = (x – 1) (x + 2) (x – 3) = (–1) (2) (–3)
= 6 > 0)
f ′(x) > 0 when – 2 < x < 1.

So

Thus,
f is increasing in (– 2, 1).
Now consider the interval (1, 3), i.e., when 1 < x < 3. In this case, we have
x – 1 > 0, x + 2 > 0 and x – 3 < 0.
So,

f ′(x) < 0 when 1 < x < 3.

Thus,

f is decreasing in (1, 3).

Finally, consider the interval (3, ∞), i.e., when x > 3. In this case, we have x – 1 > 0,
x + 2 > 0 and x – 3 > 0. So f ′(x) > 0 when x > 3.
Thus, f is increasing in the interval (3, ∞).

PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
v Proofs are to Mathematics what calligraphy is to poetry.
Mathematical works do consist of proofs just as
poems do consist of characters.
— VLADIMIR ARNOLD v

A.1.1 Introduction
In Classes IX, X and XI, we have learnt about the concepts of a statement, compound
statement, negation, converse and contrapositive of a statement; axioms, conjectures,
theorems and deductive reasoning.
Here, we will discuss various methods of proving mathematical propositions.

A.1.2 What is a Proof?
Proof of a mathematical statement consists of sequence of statements, each statement
being justified with a definition or an axiom or a proposition that is previously established
by the method of deduction using only the allowed logical rules.
Thus, each proof is a chain of deductive arguments each of which has its premises
and conclusions. Many a times, we prove a proposition directly from what is given in
the proposition. But some times it is easier to prove an equivalent proposition rather
than proving the proposition itself. This leads to, two ways of proving a proposition
directly or indirectly and the proofs obtained are called direct proof and indirect proof
and further each has three different ways of proving which is discussed below.
Direct Proof It is the proof of a proposition in which we directly start the proof with
what is given in the proposition.
(i) Straight forward approach It is a chain of arguments which leads directly from
what is given or assumed, with the help of axioms, definitions or already proved
theorems, to what is to be proved using rules of logic.
Consider the following example:
Example 1 Show that if x2 – 5x + 6 = 0, then x = 3 or x = 2.
Solution x2 – 5x + 6 = 0 (given)

188

MATHEMATICS

⇒ (x – 3) (x – 2) = 0 (replacing an expression by an equal/equivalent expression)
⇒ x – 3 = 0 or x – 2 = 0 (from the established theorem ab = 0 ⇒ either a = 0 or
b = 0, for a, b in R)
⇒ x – 3 + 3 = 0 + 3 or x – 2 + 2 = 0 + 2 (adding equal quantities on either side of the
equation does not alter the nature of the
equation)
⇒ x + 0 = 3 or x + 0 = 2 (using the identity property of integers under addition)
⇒ x = 3 or x = 2 (using the identity property of integers under addition)
Hence, x2 – 5x + 6 = 0 implies x = 3 or x = 2.
Explanation Let p be the given statement “x2 – 5x + 6 = 0” and q be the conclusion
statement “x = 3 or x = 2”.
From the statement p, we deduced the statement r : “(x – 3) (x – 2) = 0” by
replacing the expression x2 – 5x + 6 in the statement p by another expression (x – 3)
(x – 2) which is equal to x2 – 5x + 6.
There arise two questions:
(i) How does the expression (x – 3) (x – 2) is equal to the expression x2 – 5x + 6?
(ii) How can we replace an expression with another expression which is equal to
the former?
The first one is proved in earlier classes by factorization, i.e.,
x2 – 5x + 6 = x2 – 3x – 2x + 6 = x (x – 3) –2 (x – 3) = (x – 3) (x – 2).
The second one is by valid form of argumentation (rules of logic)
Next this statement r becomes premises or given and deduce the statement s
“ x – 3 = 0 or x – 2 = 0” and the reasons are given in the brackets.
This process continues till we reach the conclusion.
The symbolic equivalent of the argument is to prove by deduction that p ⇒ q
is true.
Starting with p, we deduce p ⇒ r ⇒ s ⇒ … ⇒ q. This implies that “p ⇒ q” is true.
Example 2 Prove that the function f : R → R
defined by f (x) = 2x + 5 is one-one.
Solution Note that a function f is one-one if
f (x1) = f (x2) ⇒ x1 = x2 (definition of one-one function)
Now, given that
f (x1) = f (x2), i.e., 2x1+ 5 = 2x2 + 5
⇒
2x1+ 5 – 5 = 2x2 + 5 – 5 (adding the same quantity on both sides)

⇒

Hence, the given function is one-one.
(ii) Mathematical Induction
Mathematical induction, is a strategy, of proving a proposition which is deductive in
nature. The whole basis of proof of this method depends on the following axiom:
For a given subset S of N, if
(i) the natural number 1 ∈ S and
(ii) the natural number k + 1 ∈ S whenever k ∈ S, then S = N.
According to the principle of mathematical induction, if a statement “S(n) is true
for n = 1” (or for some starting point j), and if “S(n) is true for n = k” implies that “S(n)
is true for n = k + 1” (whatever integer k ≥ j may be), then the statement is true for any
positive integer n, for all n ≥ j.
We now consider some examples.
Example 3 Show that if
 cos θ sin θ 
 cos n θ sin n θ 
, then An = 
A= 


 − sin θ cos θ 
 − sin n θ cos n θ

Solution We have
 cos n θ sin n θ 
P(n) : An = 

 − sin n θ cos n θ

We note that

 cos θ sin θ 
P(1) : A1 = 

 − sin θ cos θ 

Therefore, P(1) is true.
Assume that P(k) is true, i.e.,
 cos k θ sin k θ 
P(k) : Ak = 

 − sin k θ cos k θ 

MATHEMATICS

We want to prove that P(k + 1) is true whenever P(k) is true, i.e.,
 cos ( k + 1) θ sin ( k + 1) θ 
P(k + 1) : Ak+1 = 

 − sin( k + 1) θ cos ( k + 1 ) θ 

Now
Since P(k) is true, we have

Ak+1 = Ak . A
 cos k θ sin k θ   cos θ sin θ 
Ak+1 = 
 

 − sin k θ cos k θ  − sin θ cos θ 

cos k θ sin θ + sin k θ cos θ 
 cos k θ cos θ − sin k θ sin θ
= 

 − sin k θ cos θ − cos k θ sin θ − sin k θ sin θ + cos k θ cos θ 
(by matrix multiplication)
 cos ( k + 1) θ sin ( k + 1) θ 
= 

 − sin( k + 1) θ cos ( k + 1 ) θ 
Thus, P(k + 1) is true whenever P(k) is true.
Hence, P(n) is true for all n ≥ 1 (by the principle of mathematical induction).

(iii) Proof by cases or by exhaustion
This method of proving a statement p ⇒ q is possible only when p can be split into
several cases, r, s, t (say) so that p = r ∨ s ∨ t (where “ ∨ ” is the symbol for “OR”).
If the conditionals
r ⇒ q;
s ⇒ q;
and
t⇒q
are proved, then (r ∨ s ∨ t) ⇒ q, is proved and so p ⇒ q is proved.
The method consists of examining every possible case of the hypothesis. It is
practically convenient only when the number of possible cases are few.
Example 4 Show that in any triangle ABC,
a = b cos C + c cos B
Solution Let p be the statement “ABC is any triangle” and q be the statement
“a = b cos C + c cos B”
Let ABC be a triangle. From A draw AD a perpendicular to BC (BC produced if
necessary).
As we know that any triangle has to be either acute or obtuse or right angled, we
can split p into three statements r, s and t, where

r : ABC is an acute angled triangle with ∠ C is acute.
s : ABC is an obtuse angled triangle with ∠ C is obtuse.
t : ABC is a right angled triangle with ∠ C is right angle.
Hence, we prove the theorem by three cases.
Case (i) When ∠ C is acute (Fig. A1.1).
From the right angled triangle ADB,

BD

i.e.

BD = AB cos B
= c cos B

From the right angled triangle ADC,

CD

AC
CD = AC cos C
= b cos C
Now
a = BD + CD

i.e.

Now
i.e.

a = BC = BD – CD
a = c cos B – ( – b cos C)
a = c cos B + b cos C
Case (iii) When ∠ C is a right angle (Fig A1.3).
From the right angled triangle ACB,

... (2)

BC
= cos B
AB
i.e.
BC = AB cos B
a = c cos B,
Fig A1.3
and
b cos C = b cos 900 = 0.
Thus, we may write
a = 0 + c cos B
= b cos C + c cos B
... (3)
From (1), (2) and (3). We assert that for any triangle ABC,
a = b cos C + c cos B
By case (i), r ⇒ q is proved.
By case (ii), s ⇒ q is proved.
By case (iii), t ⇒ q is proved.
Hence, from the proof by cases, (r ∨ s ∨ t) ⇒ q is proved, i.e., p ⇒ q is proved.
Indirect Proof Instead of proving the given proposition directly, we establish the proof
of the proposition through proving a proposition which is equivalent to the given
proposition.
(i) Proof by contradiction (Reductio Ad Absurdum) : Here, we start with the
assumption that the given statement is false. By rules of logic, we arrive at a
conclusion contradicting the assumption and hence it is inferred that the assumption
is wrong and hence the given statement is true.
Let us illustrate this method by an example.
Example 5 Show that the set of all prime numbers is infinite.
Solution Let P be the set of all prime numbers. We take the negation of the statement
“the set of all prime numbers is infinite”, i.e., we assume the set of all prime numbers
to be finite. Hence, we can list all the prime numbers as P1, P2, P3,..., Pk (say). Note
that we have assumed that there is no prime number other than P1, P2, P3,..., Pk .
Now consider N = (P1 P2 P3…Pk) + 1 ... (1)
N is not in the list as N is larger than any of the numbers in the list.
N is either prime or composite.

If N is a prime, then by (1), there exists a prime number which is not listed.
On the other hand, if N is composite, it should have a prime divisor. But none of the
numbers in the list can divide N, because they all leave the remainder 1. Hence, the
prime divisor should be other than the one in the list.
Thus, in both the cases whether N is a prime or a composite, we ended up with
contradiction to the fact that we have listed all the prime numbers.
Hence, our assumption that set of all prime numbers is finite is false.
Thus, the set of all prime numbers is infinite.

ANote Observe that the above proof also uses the method of proof by cases.
(ii) Proof by using contrapositive statement of the given statement
Instead of proving the conditional p ⇒ q, we prove its equivalent, i.e.,
~ q ⇒ ~ p. (students can verify).
The contrapositive of a conditional can be formed by interchanging the conclusion
and the hypothesis and negating both.
Example 6 Prove that the function f : R → R defined by f (x) = 2x + 5 is one-one.
Solution A function is one-one if f (x1) = f (x2) ⇒ x1 = x2.
Using this we have to show that “2x1+ 5 = 2x2 + 5” ⇒ “x1 = x2”. This is of the form
p ⇒ q, where, p is 2x1+ 5 = 2x2 + 5 and q : x1 = x2. We have proved this in Example 2
of “direct method”.
We can also prove the same by using contrapositive of the statement. Now
contrapositive of this statement is ~ q ⇒ ~ p, i.e., contrapositive of “ if f (x1) = f (x2),
then x1 = x2” is “if x1 ≠x2, then f (x1) ≠ f (x2)”.
Now

x1 ≠ x 2

⇒

2x1 ≠ 2x 2

⇒

2x1+ 5 ≠ 2x2 + 5

⇒

f (x1) ≠ f (x 2).

Since “~ q ⇒ ~ p”, is equivalent to “p ⇒ q” the proof is complete.
Example 7 Show that “if a matrix A is invertible, then A is non singular”.
Solution Writing the above statement in symbolic form, we have
p ⇒ q, where, p is “matrix A is invertible” and q is “A is non singular”
Instead of proving the given statement, we prove its contrapositive statement, i.e.,
if A is not a non singular matrix, then the matrix A is not invertible.

If A is not a non singular matrix, then it means the matrix A is singular, i.e.,
|A| = 0
A–1 =

Then

adj A
does not exist as | A | = 0
|A|

Hence, A is not invertible.
Thus, we have proved that if A is not a non singular matrix, then A is not invertible.
i.e., ~ q ⇒ ~ p.
Hence, if a matrix A is invertible, then A is non singular.
(iii) Proof by a counter example
In the history of Mathematics, there are occasions when all attempts to find a
valid proof of a statement fail and the uncertainty of the truth value of the statement
remains unresolved.
In such a situation, it is beneficial, if we find an example to falsify the statement.
The example to disprove the statement is called a counter example. Since the disproof
of a proposition p ⇒ q is merely a proof of the proposition ~ (p ⇒ q). Hence, this is
also a method of proof.
n

Example 8 For each n, 2 2 + 1 is a prime (n ∈ N).
This was once thought to be true on the basis that
1

2 2 + 1 = 22 + 1 = 5 is a prime.
2

2 2 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 17 is a prime.
3

22 + 1 = 28 + 1 = 257 is a prime.

However, at first sight the generalisation looks to be correct. But, eventually it was
5

2 2 + 1 = 232 + 1 = 4294967297

shown that

which is not a prime since 4294967297 = 641 × 6700417 (a product of two numbers).
n

So the generalisation “For each n, 22 + 1 is a prime (n ∈ N)” is false.
5

Just this one example 22 + 1 is sufficient to disprove the generalisation. This is the
counter example.
n

Thus, we have proved that the generalisation “For each n, 2 2 + 1 is a prime
(n ∈ N)” is not true in general.

Example 9 Every continuous function is differentiable.
Proof We consider some functions given by
(i) f (x) = x2
(ii) g(x) = ex
(iii) h (x) = sin x
These functions are continuous for all values of x. If we check for their
differentiability, we find that they are all differentiable for all the values of x. This
makes us to believe that the generalisation “Every continuous function is differentiable”
may be true. But if we check the differentiability of the function given by “φ (x) = | x |”
which is continuous, we find that it is not differentiable at x = 0. This means that the
statement “Every continuous function is differentiable” is false, in general. Just this
one function “φ (x) = | x |” is sufficient to disprove the statement. Hence, “φ (x) = | x |”
is called a counter example to disprove “Every continuous function is differentiable”.

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
A.2.1 Introduction
In class XI, we have learnt about mathematical modelling as an attempt to study some
part (or form) of some real-life problems in mathematical terms, i.e., the conversion of
a physical situation into mathematics using some suitable conditions. Roughly speaking
mathematical modelling is an activity in which we make models to describe the behaviour
of various phenomenal activities of our interest in many ways using words, drawings or
sketches, computer programs, mathematical formulae etc.
In earlier classes, we have observed that solutions to many problems, involving
applications of various mathematical concepts, involve mathematical modelling in one
way or the other. Therefore, it is important to study mathematical modelling as a separate
topic.
In this chapter, we shall further study mathematical modelling of some real-life
problems using techniques/results from matrix, calculus and linear programming.

A.2.2 Why Mathematical Modelling?
Students are aware of the solution of word problems in arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry
and linear programming etc. Sometimes we solve the problems without going into the
physical insight of the situational problems. Situational problems need physical insight
that is introduction of physical laws and some symbols to compare the mathematical
results obtained with practical values. To solve many problems faced by us, we need a
technique and this is what is known as mathematical modelling. Let us consider the
following problems:
(i) To find the width of a river (particularly, when it is difficult to cross the river).
(ii) To find the optimal angle in case of shot-put (by considering the variables
such as : the height of the thrower, resistance of the media, acceleration due to
gravity etc.).
(iii) To find the height of a tower (particularly, when it is not possible to reach the top
of the tower).
(iv) To find the temperature at the surface of the Sun.

(v) Why heart patients are not allowed to use lift? (without knowing the physiology
of a human being).
(vi) To find the mass of the Earth.
(vii) Estimate the yield of pulses in India from the standing crops (a person is not
allowed to cut all of it).
(viii) Find the volume of blood inside the body of a person (a person is not allowed to
bleed completely).
(ix) Estimate the population of India in the year 2020 (a person is not allowed to wait
till then).
All of these problems can be solved and infact have been solved with the help of
Mathematics using mathematical modelling. In fact, you might have studied the methods
for solving some of them in the present textbook itself. However, it will be instructive if
you first try to solve them yourself and that too without the help of Mathematics, if
possible, you will then appreciate the power of Mathematics and the need for
mathematical modelling.

A.2.3 Principles of Mathematical Modelling
Mathematical modelling is a principled activity and so it has some principles behind it.
These principles are almost philosophical in nature. Some of the basic principles of
mathematical modelling are listed below in terms of instructions:
(i) Identify the need for the model. (for what we are looking for)
(ii) List the parameters/variables which are required for the model.
(iii) Identify the available relevent data. (what is given?)
(iv) Identify the circumstances that can be applied (assumptions)
(v) Identify the governing physical principles.
(vi) Identify
(a) the equations that will be used.
(b) the calculations that will be made.
(c) the solution which will follow.
(vii) Identify tests that can check the
(a) consistency of the model.
(b) utility of the model.
(viii) Identify the parameter values that can improve the model.

MATHEMATICS

The above principles of mathematical modelling lead to the following: steps for
mathematical modelling.
Step 1: Identify the physical situation.
Step 2: Convert the physical situation into a mathematical model by introducing
parameters / variables and using various known physical laws and symbols.
Step 3: Find the solution of the mathematical problem.
Step 4: Interpret the result in terms of the original problem and compare the result
with observations or experiments.
Step 5: If the result is in good agreement, then accept the model. Otherwise modify
the hypotheses / assumptions according to the physical situation and go to
Step 2.
The above steps can also be viewed through the following diagram:

Fig A.2.1
Example 1 Find the height of a given tower using mathematical modelling.
Solution Step 1 Given physical situation is “to find the height of a given tower”.
Step 2 Let AB be the given tower (Fig A.2.2). Let PQ be an observer measuring the
height of the tower with his eye at P. Let PQ = h and let height of tower be H. Let α
be the angle of elevation from the eye of the observer to the top of the tower.

or

... (1)

Step 3 Note that the values of the parameters h, l and α (using sextant) are known to
the observer and so (1) gives the solution of the problem.
Step 4 In case, if the foot of the tower is not accessible, i.e., when l is not known to the
observer, let β be the angle of depression from P to the foot B of the tower. So from
∆PQB, we have
tan β =

PQ h

QB l

Step 5 is not required in this situation as exact values of the parameters h, l, α and β
are known.
Example 2 Let a business firm produces three types of products P1, P2 and P3 that
uses three types of raw materials R1, R2 and R3. Let the firm has purchase orders from
two clients F1 and F2. Considering the situation that the firm has a limited quantity of
R1, R2 and R3, respectively, prepare a model to determine the quantities of the raw
material R1, R2 and R3 required to meet the purchase orders.
Solution Step 1 The physical situation is well identified in the problem.
Step 2 Let A be a matrix that represents purchase orders from the two clients F1 and
F2. Then, A is of the form
P1 P2 P3
F1 • • • 
A= 

Let B be the matrix that represents the amount of raw materials R1, R2 and R3,
required to manufacture each unit of the products P1, P2 and P3. Then, B is of the form

is given by the following matrix

which in fact gives the desired quantities of the raw materials R1, R2 and R3 to fulfill
the purchase orders of the two clients F1 and F2.

and the available raw materials are 330 units of R1, 455 units of R2 and 140 units of R3.

This clearly shows that to meet the purchase order of F1 and F2, the raw material
required is 335 units of R1, 467 units of R2 and 147 units of R3 which is much more than
the available raw material. Since the amount of raw material required to manufacture
each unit of the three products is fixed, we can either ask for an increase in the
available raw material or we may ask the clients to reduce their orders.

This requires 311 units of R1, 436 units of R2 and 138 units of R3 which are well
below the available raw materials, i.e., 330 units of R1, 455 units of R2 and 140 units of
R3. Thus, if the revised purchase orders of the clients are given by A1, then the firm
can easily supply the purchase orders of the two clients.
Note One may further modify A so as to make full use of the available
A
raw material.
Query Can we make a mathematical model with a given B and with fixed quantities of
the available raw material that can help the firm owner to ask the clients to modify their
orders in such a way that the firm makes the full use of its available raw material?
The answer to this query is given in the following example:
Example 4 Suppose P1, P2, P3 and R1, R2, R3 are as in Example 2. Let the firm has
330 units of R1, 455 units of R2 and 140 units of R3 available with it and let the amount
of raw materials R1, R2 and R3 required to manufacture each unit of the three products
is given by
R1 R 2 R3
P1 3 4 0 
B = P2  7 9 3 
P3 5 12 7 

How many units of each product is to be made so as to utilise the full available raw
material?
Solution Step 1 The situation is easily identifiable.
Step 2 Suppose the firm produces x units of P1, y units of P2 and z units of P3. Since
product P1 requires 3 units of R1, P2 requires 7 units of R1 and P3 requires 5 units of R1
(observe matrix B) and the total number of units, of R1, available is 330, we have
3x + 7y + 5z = 330 (for raw material R1)
Similarly, we have
4x + 9y + 12z = 455 (for raw material R2)
and
3y + 7z = 140 (for raw material R3)
This system of equations can be expressed in matrix form as

This gives x = 20, y = 35 and z = 5. Thus, the firm can produce 20 units of P1, 35
units of P2 and 5 units of P3 to make full use of its available raw material.
Remark One may observe that if the manufacturer decides to manufacture according
to the available raw material and not according to the purchase orders of the two
clients F1 and F2 (as in Example 3), he/she is unable to meet these purchase orders as
F1 demanded 6 units of P3 where as the manufacturer can make only 5 units of P3.
Example 5 A manufacturer of medicines is preparing a production plan of medicines
M1 and M2. There are sufficient raw materials available to make 20000 bottles of M1
and 40000 bottles of M2, but there are only 45000 bottles into which either of the
medicines can be put. Further, it takes 3 hours to prepare enough material to fill 1000
bottles of M1, it takes 1 hour to prepare enough material to fill 1000 bottles of M2 and
there are 66 hours available for this operation. The profit is Rs 8 per bottle for M1 and
Rs 7 per bottle for M2. How should the manufacturer schedule his/her production in
order to maximise profit?
Solution Step 1 To find the number of bottles of M1 and M2 in order to maximise the
profit under the given hypotheses.
Step 2 Let x be the number of bottles of type M1 medicine and y be the number of
bottles of type M2 medicine. Since profit is Rs 8 per bottle for M1 and Rs 7 per bottle
for M2, therefore the objective function (which is to be maximised) is given by
Z ≡ Z (x, y) = 8x + 7y
The objective function is to be maximised subject to the constraints (Refer Chapter

Now observe that the profit is maximum at x = 10500 and y = 34500 and the
maximum profit is ` 325500. Hence, the manufacturer should produce 10500 bottles of
M1 medicine and 34500 bottles of M2 medicine in order to get maximum profit of

204

MATHEMATICS

Step 2 Formulation: We are given that the costs are of two types: fixed and variable.
The fixed costs are independent of the number of units produced (e.g., rent and rates),
while the variable costs increase with the number of units produced (e.g., material).
Initially, we assume that the variable costs are directly proportional to the number of
units produced — this should simplify our model. The company earn a certain amount
of money by selling its products and wants to ensure that it is maximum. For convenience,
we assume that all units produced are sold immediately.
The mathematical model
Let
x = number of units produced and sold
C = total cost of production (in rupees)
I = income from sales (in rupees)
P = profit (in rupees)
Our assumptions above state that C consists of two parts:
(i) fixed cost = a (in rupees),
(ii) variable cost = b (rupees/unit produced).
Then
C = a + bx
... (1)
Also, income I depends on selling price s (rupees/unit)
Thus
I = sx
... (2)
The profit P is then the difference between income and costs. So
P=I–C
= sx – (a + bx)
= (s – b) x – a
... (3)
We now have a mathematical model of the relationships (1) to (3) between
the variables x, C, I, P, a, b, s. These variables may be classified as:
independent
x
dependent
C, I, P
parameters
a, b, s
The manufacturer, knowing x, a, b, s can determine P.
Step 3 From (3), we can observe that for the break even point (i.e., make neither profit

Steps 4 and 5 In view of the break even point, one may conclude that if the company

and if it produces large number of units, i.e., much more than

205

a
units , then it can
s −b

make huge profit. Further, if the break even point proves to be unrealistic, then another
model could be tried or the assumptions regarding cash flow may be modified.
Remark From (3), we also have

dP
= s −b
dx
This means that rate of change of P with respect to x depends on the quantity
s – b, which is the difference of selling price and the variable cost of each product.
Thus, in order to gain profit, this should be positive and to get large gains, we need to
produce large quantity of the product and at the same time try to reduce the variable
cost.
Example 7 Let a tank contains 1000 litres of brine which contains 250 g of salt per
litre. Brine containing 200 g of salt per litre flows into the tank at the rate of 25 litres per
minute and the mixture flows out at the same rate. Assume that the mixture is kept
uniform all the time by stirring. What would be the amount of salt in the tank at
any time t?
Solution Step 1 The situation is easily identifiable.
Step 2 Let y = y (t) denote the amount of salt (in kg) in the tank at time t (in minutes)
after the inflow, outflow starts. Further assume that y is a differentiable function.
When t = 0, i.e., before the inflow–outflow of the brine starts,
y = 250 g × 1000 = 250 kg
Note that the change in y occurs due to the inflow, outflow of the mixture.
Now the inflow of brine brings salt into the tank at the rate of 5 kg per minute
(as 25 × 200 g = 5 kg) and the outflow of brine takes salt out of the tank at the rate of

Thus, the minimum amount of salt content in the tank is 200 kg.
Also, from (4), we conclude that t > 0 if and only if 0 < y – 200 < 50 i.e., if and only
if 200 < y < 250 i.e., the amount of salt content in the tank after the start of inflow and
outflow of the brine is between 200 kg and 250 kg.

Limitations of Mathematical Modelling
Till today many mathematical models have been developed and applied successfully
to understand and get an insight into thousands of situations. Some of the subjects like
mathematical physics, mathematical economics, operations research, bio-mathematics
etc. are almost synonymous with mathematical modelling.
But there are still a large number of situations which are yet to be modelled. The
reason behind this is that either the situation are found to be very complex or the
mathematical models formed are mathematically intractable.

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING

207

The development of the powerful computers and super computers has enabled us
to mathematically model a large number of situations (even complex situations). Due
to these fast and advanced computers, it has been possible to prepare more realistic
models which can obtain better agreements with observations.
However, we do not have good guidelines for choosing various parameters / variables
and also for estimating the values of these parameters / variables used in a mathematical
model. Infact, we can prepare reasonably accurate models to fit any data by choosing
five or six parameters / variables. We require a minimal number of parameters / variables
to be able to estimate them accurately.
Mathematical modelling of large or complex situations has its own special problems.
These type of situations usually occur in the study of world models of environment,
oceanography, pollution control etc. Mathematical modellers from all disciplines —
mathematics, computer science, physics, engineering, social sciences, etc., are involved
in meeting these challenges with courage.

Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework, 2005, recommends that children’s life at school
must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the
legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap
between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the
basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to
discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the
direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on
Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers
will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative
activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children
generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.
Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key
reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity
and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not
as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual
calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.
The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a
source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The
textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to
opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities
requiring hands-on experience.

Rationalisation of Content in the Textbooks
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students.
The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and
providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background,
the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes.
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken
into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
•

Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class

•

Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject

•

Difficulty level

•

Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from
teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning

•

Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above.

Preface
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) had constituted
21 Focus Groups on Teaching of various subjects related to School Education,
to review the National Curriculum Framework for School Education - 2000
(NCFSE - 2000) in face of new emerging challenges and transformations occurring in
the fields of content and pedagogy under the contexts of National and International
spectrum of school education. These Focus Groups made general and specific comments
in their respective areas. Consequently, based on these reports of Focus Groups, National
Curriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 was developed.
NCERT designed the new syllabi and constituted Textbook Development
Teams for Classes XI and XII to prepare textbooks in Mathematics under the new
guidelines and new syllabi. The textbook for Class XI is already in use, which was
brought in 2005.
The first draft of the present book (Class XII) was prepared by the team
consisting of NCERT faculty, experts and practicing teachers. The draft was refined
by the development team in different meetings. This draft of the book was exposed
to a group of practicing teachers teaching Mathematics at higher secondary stage
in different parts of the country, in a review workshop organised by the NCERT at
Delhi. The teachers made useful comments and suggestions which were incorporated
in the draft textbook. The draft textbook was finalised by an editorial board constituted
out of the development team. Finally, the Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics
and the Monitoring Committee constituted by the HRD Ministry, Government of India
have approved the draft of the textbook.
In the fitness of things, let us cite some of the essential features dominating the
textbook. These characteristics have reflections in almost all the chapters. The existing
textbook contains thirteen main chapters and two appendices. Each chapter contains
the followings :
§ Introduction: Highlighting the importance of the topic; connection with earlier
studied topics; brief mention about the new concepts to be discussed in the
chapter.
§ Organisation of chapter into sections comprising one or more concepts/
subconcepts.
§ Motivating and introducing the concepts/subconcepts. Illustrations have been
provided wherever possible.

Rationalised 2023-24

viii

§ Proofs/problem solving involving deductive or inductive reasoning, multiplicity
of approaches wherever possible have been inducted.
§ Geometric viewing / visualisation of concepts have been emphasized whenever
needed.
§ Applications of mathematical concepts have also been integrated with allied
subjects like Science and Social Sciences.
§ Adequate and variety of examples/exercises have been given in each section.
§ For refocusing and strengthening the understanding and skill of problem solving
and applicabilities, miscellaneous types of examples/exercises have been
provided involving two or more subconcepts at a time at the end of the chapter.
The scope of challenging problems to talented minority have been reflected
conducive to the recommendation as reflected in NCF-2005.
§ For more motivational purpose, brief historical background of topics have been
provided at the end of the chapter and at the beginning of each chapter, relevant
quotation and photograph of eminent mathematician who have contributed
significantly in the development of the topic undertaken, are also provided.
§ Lastly, for direct recapitulation of main concepts, formulas and results, brief
summary of the chapter has also been provided.
I am thankful to Professor Krishan Kumar, Director, NCERT who constituted the
team and invited me to join this national endeavour for the improvement of Mathematics
education. He has provided us with an enlightened perspective and a very conducive
environment. This made the task of preparing the book much more enjoyable and
rewarding. I express my gratitude to Professor J.V. Narlikar, Chairperson of the Advisory
Group in Science and Mathematics, for his specific suggestions and advice towards
the improvement of the book from time to time. I, also, thank Professor
G. Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT for his help from time to time.
I express my sincere thanks to Professor Hukum Singh, Chief Coordinator and
Head, DESM, Dr. V. P. Singh, Coordinator and Professor, S. K. Singh Gautam who
have been helping for the success of this project academically as well as administratively.
Also, I would like to place on records my appreciation and thanks to all the members
of the team and the teachers who have been associated with this noble cause in one or
the other form.

INTEGRALS
v Just as a mountaineer climbs a mountain – because it is there, so
a good mathematics student studies new material because
it is there. — JAMES B. BRISTOL v

7.1 Introduction
Differential Calculus is centred on the concept of the
derivative. The original motivation for the derivative was
the problem of defining tangent lines to the graphs of
functions and calculating the slope of such lines. Integral
Calculus is motivated by the problem of defining and
calculating the area of the region bounded by the graph of
the functions.
If a function f is differentiable in an interval I, i.e., its
derivative f ′exists at each point of I, then a natural question
arises that given f ′at each point of I, can we determine
the function? The functions that could possibly have given
G .W. Leibnitz
function as a derivative are called anti derivatives (or
(1646 -1716)
primitive) of the function. Further, the formula that gives
all these anti derivatives is called the indefinite integral of the function and such
process of finding anti derivatives is called integration. Such type of problems arise in
many practical situations. For instance, if we know the instantaneous velocity of an
object at any instant, then there arises a natural question, i.e., can we determine the
position of the object at any instant? There are several such practical and theoretical
situations where the process of integration is involved. The development of integral
calculus arises out of the efforts of solving the problems of the following types:
(a) the problem of finding a function whenever its derivative is given,
(b) the problem of finding the area bounded by the graph of a function under certain
conditions.
These two problems lead to the two forms of the integrals, e.g., indefinite and
definite integrals, which together constitute the Integral Calculus.

MATHEMATICS

There is a connection, known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, between
indefinite integral and definite integral which makes the definite integral as a practical
tool for science and engineering. The definite integral is also used to solve many interesting
problems from various disciplines like economics, finance and probability.
In this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of indefinite and definite
integrals and their elementary properties including some techniques of integration.

7.2 Integration as an Inverse Process of Differentiation
Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. Instead of differentiating a function,
we are given the derivative of a function and asked to find its primitive, i.e., the original
function. Such a process is called integration or anti differentiation.
Let us consider the following examples:
We know that

and

d
(sin x) = cos x
dx

... (1)

d x3
( ) = x2
dx 3

... (2)

d x
(e ) = e x
... (3)
dx
We observe that in (1), the function cos x is the derived function of sin x. We say

x3
and
3
ex are the anti derivatives (or integrals) of x2 and ex, respectively. Again, we note that
for any real number C, treated as constant function, its derivative is zero and hence, we
can write (1), (2) and (3) as follows :

that sin x is an anti derivative (or an integral) of cos x. Similarly, in (2) and (3),

d x
d
d x3
(e + C) = e x
(sin x + C) = cos x ,
( + C) = x 2 and
dx
dx 3
dx
Thus, anti derivatives (or integrals) of the above cited functions are not unique.
Actually, there exist infinitely many anti derivatives of each of these functions which
can be obtained by choosing C arbitrarily from the set of real numbers. For this reason
C is customarily referred to as arbitrary constant. In fact, C is the parameter by
varying which one gets different anti derivatives (or integrals) of the given function.
d
F (x) = f (x) , ∀ x ∈ I (interval),
More generally, if there is a function F such that

then for any arbitrary real number C, (also called constant of integration)

{F + C, C ∈ R} denotes a family of anti derivatives of f.

Thus,

Remark Functions with same derivatives differ by a constant. To show this, let g and h
be two functions having the same derivatives on an interval I.
Consider the function f = g – h defined by f (x) = g (x) – h(x), ∀ x ∈ I

df
= f′ = g′ – h′ giving f′ (x) = g′ (x) – h′ (x) ∀ x ∈ I
dx

Then

or
f ′ (x) = 0, ∀ x ∈ I by hypothesis,
i.e., the rate of change of f with respect to x is zero on I and hence f is constant.
In view of the above remark, it is justified to infer that the family {F + C, C ∈ R}
provides all possible anti derivatives of f.
We introduce a new symbol, namely, ∫ f (x ) dx which will represent the entire
class of anti derivatives read as the indefinite integral of f with respect to x.
Symbolically, we write ∫ f (x ) dx = F (x) + C .
Notation Given that

dy
= f (x ) , we write y = ∫ f (x ) dx .

7.2.1 Some properties of indefinite integral
In this sub section, we shall derive some properties of indefinite integrals.
(I) The process of differentiation and integration are inverses of each other in the
sense of the following results :

d
f (x) dx = f (x)
dx ∫
and

∫ f ′(x) dx = f (x) + C, where C is any arbitrary constant.

Proof Let F be any anti derivative of f, i.e.,

d
F(x ) = f (x)
dx
Then
Therefore

∫ f (x) dx = F(x) + C
d
d
f (x) dx =
( F (x) + C )
∫
dx
dx
=

d
F (x ) = f (x)
dx

Similarly, we note that
f ′(x) =
and hence

d
f (x)
dx

∫ f ′(x) dx = f (x) + C

where C is arbitrary constant called constant of integration.
(II) Two indefinite integrals with the same derivative lead to the same family of
curves and so they are equivalent.

Hence

∫ f (x) dx – ∫ g (x) dx = C, where C is any real number

or

∫ f (x) dx = ∫ g (x) dx + C

(Why?)

{∫ f (x) dx + C , C ∈ R}
{∫ g (x) dx + C , C ∈ R} are identical.

So the families of curves

(III)

∫ [ f (x) + g (x)] dx = ∫ f (x) dx + ∫ g (x) dx
Proof

By Property (I), we have

(IV) For any real number k, ∫ k f (x ) dx = k ∫ f (x) dx

(V) Properties (III) and (IV) can be generalised to a finite number of functions
f1, f2, ..., fn and the real numbers, k1, k2, ..., kn giving

∫ [k1 f1 (x) + k2 f 2 (x) + ... + kn f n (x)] dx
= k1 ∫ f1 (x) dx + k 2 ∫ f 2 (x) dx + ... + kn ∫ fn (x) dx .
To find an anti derivative of a given function, we search intuitively for a function
whose derivative is the given function. The search for the requisite function for finding
an anti derivative is known as integration by the method of inspection. We illustrate it
through some examples.
Example 1 Write an anti derivative for each of the following functions using the
method of inspection:
(ii) 3x2 + 4x3

(i) cos 2x

Solution One anti derivative of f (x) is x4 – 6x since

d 4

dx
Therefore, the anti derivative F is given by
F(x) = x4 – 6x + C, where C is constant.

234

MATHEMATICS

Given that

F(0) = 3, which gives,

3 = 0 – 6 × 0 + C or C = 3
Hence, the required anti derivative is the unique function F defined by
F(x) = x4 – 6x + 3.
Remarks
(i) We see that if F is an anti derivative of f, then so is F + C, where C is any
constant. Thus, if we know one anti derivative F of a function f, we can write
down an infinite number of anti derivatives of f by adding any constant to F
expressed by F(x) + C, C ∈ R. In applications, it is often necessary to satisfy an
additional condition which then determines a specific value of C giving unique
anti derivative of the given function.
(ii) Sometimes, F is not expressible in terms of elementary functions viz., polynomial,
logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric functions and their inverses etc. We are
therefore blocked for finding ∫ f (x ) dx . For example, it is not possible to find

∫e

– x2

dx by inspection since we can not find a function whose derivative is e – x

formulae are modified accordingly. For instance

7.3 Methods of Integration
In previous section, we discussed integrals of those functions which were readily
obtainable from derivatives of some functions. It was based on inspection, i.e., on the
search of a function F whose derivative is f which led us to the integral of f. However,
this method, which depends on inspection, is not very suitable for many functions.
Hence, we need to develop additional techniques or methods for finding the integrals
by reducing them into standard forms. Prominent among them are methods based on:
1. Integration by Substitution
2. Integration using Partial Fractions
3. Integration by Parts
7.3.1 Integration by substitution
In this section, we consider the method of integration by substitution.
The given integral ∫ f (x ) dx can be transformed into another form by changing
the independent variable x to t by substituting x = g (t).

We write

dx

dt
dx = g′(t) dt
I = ∫ f ( x) dx = ∫ f ( g (t )) g ′(t ) dt

Thus

This change of variable formula is one of the important tools available to us in the
name of integration by substitution. It is often important to guess what will be the useful
substitution. Usually, we make a substitution for a function whose derivative also occurs
in the integrand as illustrated in the following examples.

∫ sin mx dx = m ∫ sin t dt = – m cos t + C = – m cos mx + C
(ii) Derivative of x2 + 1 is 2x. Thus, we use the substitution x2 + 1 = t so that
2x dx = dt.

∫ 2 x sin (x + 1) dx = ∫ sin t dt = – cos t + C = – cos (x + 1) + C

7.5 Integration by Partial Fractions
Recall that a rational function is defined as the ratio of two polynomials in the form

P(x)
, where P (x) and Q(x) are polynomials in x and Q(x) ≠ 0. If the degree of P(x)
Q(x)
is less than the degree of Q(x), then the rational function is called proper, otherwise, it
is called improper. The improper rational functions can be reduced to the proper rational

is improper, then

Q(x)
Q(x)
Q(x)

P1 (x)
is a proper rational function. As we know
Q(x)

how to integrate polynomials, the integration of any rational function is reduced to the
integration of a proper rational function. The rational functions which we shall consider
here for integration purposes will be those whose denominators can be factorised into
linear and quadratic factors. Assume that we want to evaluate ∫

P(x )
P(x)
dx , where
Q(x )
Q(x)

is proper rational function. It is always possible to write the integrand as a sum of
simpler rational functions by a method called partial fraction decomposition. After this,
the integration can be carried out easily using the already known methods. The following
Table 7.2 indicates the types of simpler partial fractions that are to be associated with
various kind of rational functions.

(x + 1) (x + 2)

where, real numbers A and B are to be determined suitably. This gives
1 = A (x + 2) + B (x + 1).
Equating the coefficients of x and the constant term, we get
A+B=0
and
2A + B = 1
Solving these equations, we get A =1 and B = – 1.

7.6 Integration by Parts

the product rule of differentiation, we have

MATHEMATICS

Therefore, expression (1) can be rewritten as

∫ f (x) g (x) dx = f (x) ∫ g (x) dx – ∫ [∫ g (x) dx] f ′(x) dx
∫ f (x) g (x) dx = f (x) ∫ g (x) dx – ∫ [ f ′ (x) ∫ g (x) dx] dx

i.e.,

If we take f as the first function and g as the second function, then this formula
may be stated as follows:
“The integral of the product of two functions = (first function) × (integral
of the second function) – Integral of [(differential coefficient of the first function)
× (integral of the second function)]”
Example 17 Find ∫ x cos x dx
Solution Put f (x) = x (first function) and g (x) = cos x (second function).
Then, integration by parts gives

d

∫ x cos x dx = x ∫ cos x dx – ∫ [ dx (x) ∫ cos x dx] dx
= x sin x – ∫ sin x dx = x sin x + cos x + C
Suppose, we take

f (x) = cos x and g (x) = x. Then

∫ x cos x dx = cos x ∫ x dx – ∫ [ dx (cos x) ∫ x dx] dx

Thus, it shows that the integral ∫ x cos x dx is reduced to the comparatively more
complicated integral having more power of x. Therefore, the proper choice of the first
function and the second function is significant.
Remarks
(i) It is worth mentioning that integration by parts is not applicable to product of
functions in all cases. For instance, the method does not work for ∫ x sin x dx .
The reason is that there does not exist any function whose derivative is

x sin x.
(ii) Observe that while finding the integral of the second function, we did not add
any constant of integration. If we write the integral of the second function cos x

as sin x + k, where k is any constant, then

∫ x cos x dx = x (sin x + k ) − ∫ (sin x + k ) dx
= x (sin x + k ) − ∫ (sin x dx − ∫ k dx
= x (sin x + k ) − cos x – kx + C = x sin x + cos x + C
This shows that adding a constant to the integral of the second function is
superfluous so far as the final result is concerned while applying the method of
integration by parts.
(iii) Usually, if any function is a power of x or a polynomial in x, then we take it as the
first function. However, in cases where other function is inverse trigonometric
function or logarithmic function, then we take them as first function.
Example 18 Find ∫ log x dx
Solution To start with, we are unable to guess a function whose derivative is log x. We
take log x as the first function and the constant function 1 as the second function. Then,
the integral of the second function is x.

7.7 Definite Integral
In the previous sections, we have studied about the indefinite integrals and discussed
few methods of finding them including integrals of some special functions. In this
section, we shall study what is called definite integral of a function. The definite integral
b

has a unique value. A definite integral is denoted by ∫ f (x) dx , where a is called the
a

lower limit of the integral and b is called the upper limit of the integral. The definite
integral is introduced either as the limit of a sum or if it has an anti derivative F in the
interval [a, b], then its value is the difference between the values of F at the end
points, i.e., F(b) – F(a).

7.8 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
7.8.1 Area function
b

We have defined ∫ f ( x) dx as the area of
a

the region bounded by the curve y = f (x),
the ordinates x = a and x = b and x-axis. Let x
x

be a given point in [a, b]. Then ∫ f ( x) dx
a

represents the area of the light shaded region
in Fig 7.1 [Here it is assumed that f (x) > 0 for
x ∈ [a, b], the assertion made below is
equally true for other functions as well].
The area of this shaded region depends upon
the value of x.

Fig 7.1

In other words, the area of this shaded region is a function of x. We denote this
function of x by A(x). We call the function A(x) as Area function and is given by
A (x) = ∫

x
a

f ( x ) dx

... (1)

Based on this definition, the two basic fundamental theorems have been given.
However, we only state them as their proofs are beyond the scope of this text book.
7.8.2 First fundamental theorem of integral calculus
Theorem 1 Let f be a continuous function on the closed interval [a, b] and let A (x) be
the area function. Then A′′(x) = f (x), for all x ∈ [a, b].

MATHEMATICS

7.8.3 Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus
We state below an important theorem which enables us to evaluate definite integrals
by making use of anti derivative.
Theorem 2 Let f be continuous function defined on the closed interval [a, b] and F be
b

an anti derivative of f. Then ∫ f ( x ) dx = [F( x )] ba = F (b) – F(a).
a

Remarks
b

(i) In words, the Theorem 2 tells us that ∫ f ( x) dx = (value of the anti derivative F
a

of f at the upper limit b – value of the same anti derivative at the lower limit a).
(ii) This theorem is very useful, because it gives us a method of calculating the
definite integral more easily, without calculating the limit of a sum.
(iii) The crucial operation in evaluating a definite integral is that of finding a function
whose derivative is equal to the integrand. This strengthens the relationship
between differentiation and integration.
b

(iv) In ∫ f ( x) dx , the function f needs to be well defined and continuous in [a, b].
a

For instance, the consideration of definite integral ∫

3
−2

x( x

2

1
– 1) 2 dx is erroneous

1
2

since the function f expressed by f (x) = x( x – 1) 2 is not defined in a portion
– 1 < x < 1 of the closed interval [– 2, 3].
b

Steps for calculating ∫ f ( x) dx .
a

(i) Find the indefinite integral ∫ f ( x ) dx . Let this be F(x). There is no need to keep
integration constant C because if we consider F(x) + C instead of F(x), we get
b

∫ a f ( x) dx = [F ( x) + C] a = [F(b) + C] – [F(a) + C] = F(b) – F(a) .
b

Thus, the arbitrary constant disappears in evaluating the value of the definite
integral.
b

(ii) Evaluate F(b) – F(a) = [F ( x)] a , which is the value of

b

∫ a f ( x) dx .

7.9 Evaluation of Definite Integrals by Substitution
In the previous sections, we have discussed several methods for finding the indefinite
integral. One of the important methods for finding the indefinite integral is the method
of substitution.
b

To evaluate ∫ f ( x) dx , by substitution, the steps could be as follows:
a

1. Consider the integral without limits and substitute, y = f (x) or x = g(y) to reduce
the given integral to a known form.
2. Integrate the new integrand with respect to the new variable without mentioning
the constant of integration.
3. Resubstitute for the new variable and write the answer in terms of the original
variable.
4. Find the values of answers obtained in (3) at the given limits of integral and find
the difference of the values at the upper and lower limits.

272

MATHEMATICS

Note In order to quicken this method, we can proceed as follows: After
A
performing steps 1, and 2, there is no need of step 3. Here, the integral will be kept
in the new variable itself, and the limits of the integral will accordingly be changed,
so that we can perform the last step.
Let us illustrate this by examples.
1

Example 26 Evaluate ∫ 5 x4 x5 + 1 dx .

Solution Put t = x5 + 1, then dt = 5x4 dx.

Alternatively, first we transform the integral and then evaluate the transformed integral
with new limits.
Let
t = x5 + 1. Then dt = 5 x4 dx.
Note that, when
x = – 1, t = 0 and when x = 1, t = 2
Thus, as x varies from – 1 to 1, t varies from 0 to 2

f ( x) dx = 0 , if f is an odd function, i.e., if f (– x) = – f (x).

We give the proofs of these properties one by one.
Proof of P0 It follows directly by making the substitution x = t.
Proof of P1 Let F be anti derivative of f. Then, by the second fundamental theorem of
calculus,

we

have

b

a

∫ a f ( x) dx = F (b) – F (a) = – [F (a) − F (b)] = −∫ b f ( x) dx

Here, we observe that, if a = b, then ∫ a f ( x) dx = 0 .
Proof of P2 Let F be anti derivative of f. Then
b

∫ a f ( x) dx = F(b) – F(a)
c
∫ a f ( x) dx = F(c) – F(a)

f ( x) dx = ∫ f ( x) dx + ∫

f ( x ) dx .

Let

t = 2a – x in the second integral on the right hand side. Then
dt = – dx. When x = a, t = a and when x = 2a, t = 0. Also x = 2a – t.
Therefore, the second integral becomes
2a

a

a

0

∫ a f ( x) dx = – ∫ a f (2a – t ) dt = ∫ 0 f (2a – t ) dt = ∫ 0 f (2a – x) dx

f ( x) dx = ∫ f ( x) dx + ∫ f (2a − x) dx

f ( x) dx = ∫ f ( x ) dx + ∫ f (2a − x) dx

∫ 0 f ( x) dx = ∫ 0 f ( x) dx + ∫ 0 f ( x) dx = 2∫ 0 f ( x) dx,

Let

t = – x in the first integral on the right hand side.
dt = – dx. When x = – a, t = a and when

Summary

® Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. In the differential calculus,

we are given a function and we have to find the derivative or differential of
this function, but in the integral calculus, we are to find a function whose
differential is given. Thus, integration is a process which is the inverse of
differentiation.

F( x) = f ( x ) . Then we write ∫ f ( x ) dx = F ( x ) + C . These integrals

are called indefinite integrals or general integrals, C is called constant of
integration. All these integrals differ by a constant.
® Some properties of indefinite integrals are as follows:
1. ∫ [ f ( x) + g ( x )] dx = ∫ f ( x ) dx + ∫ g ( x ) dx
2. For any real number k, ∫ k f ( x ) dx = k ∫ f ( x) dx
More generally, if f1, f2, f3, ... , fn are functions and k1, k2, ... ,kn are real
numbers. Then

∫ [k1 f1 ( x) + k2 f 2 ( x) + ... + kn f n ( x)] dx

APPLICATION OF INTEGRALS
v One should study Mathematics because it is only through Mathematics that
nature can be conceived in harmonious form. – BIRKHOFF v
8.1 Introduction
In geometry, we have learnt formulae to calculate areas
of various geometrical figures including triangles,
rectangles, trapezias and circles. Such formulae are
fundamental in the applications of mathematics to many
real life problems. The formulae of elementary geometry
allow us to calculate areas of many simple figures.
However, they are inadequate for calculating the areas
enclosed by curves. For that we shall need some concepts
of Integral Calculus.
In the previous chapter, we have studied to find the
area bounded by the curve y = f (x), the ordinates x = a,
x = b and x-axis, while calculating definite integral as the
limit of a sum. Here, in this chapter, we shall study a specific
application of integrals to find the area under simple curves,
area between lines and arcs of circles, parabolas and
ellipses (standard forms only). We shall also deal with finding
the area bounded by the above said curves.

A.L. Cauchy
(1789-1857)

8.2 Area under Simple Curves
In the previous chapter, we have studied
definite integral as the limit of a sum and
how to evaluate definite integral using
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Now,
we consider the easy and intuitive way of
finding the area bounded by the curve
y = f (x), x-axis and the ordinates x = a and
x = b. From Fig 8.1, we can think of area
under the curve as composed of large
number of very thin vertical strips. Consider
an arbitrary strip of height y and width dx,
then dA (area of the elementary strip) = ydx,
where, y = f (x).

APPLICATION OF INTEGRALS

This area is called the elementary area which is located at an arbitrary position
within the region which is specified by some value of x between a and b. We can think
of the total area A of the region between x-axis, ordinates x = a, x = b and the curve
y = f (x) as the result of adding up the elementary areas of thin strips across the region
PQRSP. Symbolically, we express

y = d is given by
d

d

A = ∫ c xdy = ∫ c g ( y) dy
Here, we consider horizontal strips as shown in
the Fig 8.2

Fig 8.2

Remark If the position of the curve under consideration is below the x-axis, then since
f (x) < 0 from x = a to x = b, as shown in Fig 8.3, the area bounded by the curve, x-axis
and the ordinates x = a, x = b come out to be negative. But, it is only the numerical
value of the area which is taken into consideration. Thus, if the area is negative, we

take its absolute value, i.e., ∫ f ( x ) dx .
a

Fig 8.3

Generally, it may happen that some portion of the curve is above x-axis and some is
below the x-axis as shown in the Fig 8.4. Here, A1 < 0 and A2 > 0. Therefore, the area
A bounded by the curve y = f (x), x-axis and the ordinates x = a and x = b is given
by A = | A1 | + A2.

Historical Note
The origin of the Integral Calculus goes back to the early period of development
of Mathematics and it is related to the method of exhaustion developed by the
mathematicians of ancient Greece. This method arose in the solution of problems
on calculating areas of plane figures, surface areas and volumes of solid bodies
etc. In this sense, the method of exhaustion can be regarded as an early method

of integration. The greatest development of method of exhaustion in the early
period was obtained in the works of Eudoxus (440 B.C.) and Archimedes
(300 B.C.)
Systematic approach to the theory of Calculus began in the 17th century.
In 1665, Newton began his work on the Calculus described by him as the theory
of fluxions and used his theory in finding the tangent and radius of curvature at
any point on a curve. Newton introduced the basic notion of inverse function
called the anti derivative (indefinite integral) or the inverse method of tangents.
During 1684-86, Leibnitz published an article in the Acta Eruditorum which
he called Calculas summatorius, since it was connected with the summation of
a number of infinitely small areas, whose sum, he indicated by the symbol ‘∫’. In
1696, he followed a suggestion made by J. Bernoulli and changed this article to
Calculus integrali. This corresponded to Newton’s inverse method of tangents.
Both Newton and Leibnitz adopted quite independent lines of approach which
was radically different. However, respective theories accomplished results that
were practically identical. Leibnitz used the notion of definite integral and what is
quite certain is that he first clearly appreciated tie up between the antiderivative
and the definite integral.
Conclusively, the fundamental concepts and theory of Integral Calculus and
primarily its relationships with Differential Calculus were developed in the work
of P.de Fermat, I. Newton and G. Leibnitz at the end of 17th century. However,
this justification by the concept of limit was only developed in the works of A.L.
Cauchy in the early 19th century. Lastly, it is worth mentioning the following
quotation by Lie Sophie’s:
“It may be said that the conceptions of differential quotient and integral which
in their origin certainly go back to Archimedes were introduced in Science by the
investigations of Kepler, Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat and Wallis .... The discovery
that differentiation and integration are inverse operations belongs to Newton
and Leibnitz”.

the chapter on Integral Calculus, we discussed how to find

An equation of the form (1) is known as a differential

Henri Poincare
(1854-1912 )

These equations arise in a variety of applications, may it be in Physics, Chemistry,
Biology, Anthropology, Geology, Economics etc. Hence, an indepth study of differential
equations has assumed prime importance in all modern scientific investigations.
In this chapter, we will study some basic concepts related to differential equation,
general and particular solutions of a differential equation, formation of differential
equations, some methods to solve a first order - first degree differential equation and
some applications of differential equations in different areas.

9.2 Basic Concepts
We are already familiar with the equations of the type:
x2 – 3x + 3 = 0
sin x + cos x = 0
x+y=7

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Let us consider the equation:

dy
+y =0
... (4)
dx
We see that equations (1), (2) and (3) involve independent and/or dependent variable
(variables) only but equation (4) involves variables as well as derivative of the dependent
variable y with respect to the independent variable x. Such an equation is called a
differential equation.
x

In general, an equation involving derivative (derivatives) of the dependent variable
with respect to independent variable (variables) is called a differential equation.
A differential equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect
to only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation, e.g.,
3

d 2 y  dy 
.... (5)
2 2 +   = 0 is an ordinary differential equation
 dx 
dx
Of course, there are differential equations involving derivatives with respect to
more than one independent variables, called partial differential equations but at this
stage we shall confine ourselves to the study of ordinary differential equations only.
Now onward, we will use the term ‘differential equation’ for ‘ordinary differential
equation’.

A Note

1. We shall prefer to use the following notations for derivatives:

dy
d2y
d3y
= y ′ , 2 = y ′′, 3 = y ′′′
dx
dx
dx
2. For derivatives of higher order, it will be inconvenient to use so many dashes
as supersuffix therefore, we use the notation yn for nth order derivative

dn y
.
dx n

9.2.1. Order of a differential equation
Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of
the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given
differential equation.
Consider the following differential equations:

dy
= ex
dx

 d3y  2  d 2y 
 3 + x  2  = 0
 dx 
 dx 

... (8)

The equations (6), (7) and (8) involve the highest derivative of first, second and
third order respectively. Therefore, the order of these equations are 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
9.2.2 Degree of a differential equation
To study the degree of a differential equation, the key point is that the differential
equation must be a polynomial equation in derivatives, i.e., y′, y″, y″′ etc. Consider the
following differential equations:
2

d 3 y  d 2 y  dy
+ 2 2  − + y = 0
dx 3
 dx  dx

... (9)

dx
dx
   

... (10)

dy
 dy 
+ sin   = 0
dx
 dx 

... (11)

We observe that equation (9) is a polynomial equation in y″′, y″ and y′, equation (10)
is a polynomial equation in y′ (not a polynomial in y though). Degree of such differential
equations can be defined. But equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in y′ and
degree of such a differential equation can not be defined.
By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in
derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order
derivative involved in the given differential equation.
In view of the above definition, one may observe that differential equations (6), (7),
(8) and (9) each are of degree one, equation (10) is of degree two while the degree of
differential equation (11) is not defined.

ANote Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always
positive integers.

In earlier Classes, we have solved the equations of the type:
x2 + 1 = 0
... (1)

sin x – cos x = 0
... (2)
Solution of equations (1) and (2) are numbers, real or complex, that will satisfy the
given equation i.e., when that number is substituted for the unknown x in the given
equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to the R.H.S..

d2y
+ y=0
... (3)
dx 2
In contrast to the first two equations, the solution of this differential equation is a
function φ that will satisfy it i.e., when the function φ is substituted for the unknown y
(dependent variable) in the given differential equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to R.H.S..
The curve y = φ (x) is called the solution curve (integral curve) of the given
differential equation. Consider the function given by
y = φ (x) = a sin (x + b),
... (4)
where a, b ∈ R. When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3),
L.H.S. = R.H.S.. So it is a solution of the differential equation (3).
Now consider the differential equation

Let a and b be given some particular values say a = 2 and b =

π
, then we get a


y = φ1(x) = 2sin  x + 

When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3) again
L.H.S. = R.H.S.. Therefore φ1 is also a solution of equation (3).

Function φ consists of two arbitrary constants (parameters) a, b and it is called
general solution of the given differential equation. Whereas function φ1 contains no
arbitrary constants but only the particular values of the parameters a and b and hence
is called a particular solution of the given differential equation.
The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution
(primitive) of the differential equation.
The solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general
solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular
solution of the differential equation.

L.H.S. = 9 e– 3x + (–3e– 3x) – 6.e– 3x = 9 e– 3x – 9 e– 3x = 0 = R.H.S..
Therefore, the given function is a solution of the given differential equation.

If F (x, y) can be expressed as a product g (x) h(y), where, g(x) is a function of x
and h(y) is a function of y, then the differential equation (1) is said to be of variable
separable type. The differential equation (1) then has the form
dy
= h (y) . g (x)
... (2)
dx
If h (y) ≠ 0, separating the variables, (2) can be rewritten as

dy = g (x) dx
h( y )

Integrating both sides of (3), we get

∫ h( y) dy = ∫ g ( x) dx

Thus, (4) provides the solutions of given differential equation in the form
H (y) = G (x) + C

Here, H (y) and G (x) are the anti derivatives of h ( y ) and g (x) respectively and

C is the arbitrary constant.

If we replace x and y by λx and λy respectively in the above functions, for any nonzero

Here, we observe that the functions F1, F 2, F 3 can be written in the form
F(λx, λy) = λn F (x, y) but F4 can not be written in this form. This leads to the following
definition:
A function F(x, y) is said to be homogeneous function of degree n if
F(λx, λy) = λn F(x, y) for any nonzero constant λ.
We note that in the above examples, F1, F2, F3 are homogeneous functions of

® An equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to

independent variable (variables) is known as a differential equation.
® Order of a differential equation is the order of the highest order derivative
occurring in the differential equation.
® Degree of a differential equation is defined if it is a polynomial equation in its
derivatives.
® Degree (when defined) of a differential equation is the highest power (positive
integer only) of the highest order derivative in it.
® A function which satisfies the given differential equation is called its solution.
The solution which contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the
differential equation is called a general solution and the solution free from
arbitrary constants is called particular solution.
® Variable separable method is used to solve such an equation in which variables
can be separated completely i.e. terms containing y should remain with dy
and terms containing x should remain with dx.

® A differential equation of the form dx + Py = Q , where P and Q are constants
or functions of x only is called a first order linear differential equation.

Historical Note
One of the principal languages of Science is that of differential equations.
Interestingly, the date of birth of differential equations is taken to be November,
11,1675, when Gottfried Wilthelm Freiherr Leibnitz (1646 - 1716) first put in black

1 2
y , thereby introducing both the symbols ∫ and dy.
2
Leibnitz was actually interested in the problem of finding a curve whose tangents
were prescribed. This led him to discover the ‘method of separation of variables’
1691. A year later he formulated the ‘method of solving the homogeneous

and white the identity ∫ y dy =

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

337

differential equations of the first order’. He went further in a very short time
to the discovery of the ‘method of solving a linear differential equation of the
first-order’. How surprising is it that all these methods came from a single man
and that too within 25 years of the birth of differential equations!
In the old days, what we now call the ‘solution’ of a differential equation, was
used to be referred to as ‘integral’ of the differential equation, the word being
coined by James Bernoulli (1654 - 1705) in 1690. The word ‘solution was first
used by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) in 1774, which was almost hundred
years since the birth of differential equations. It was Jules Henri Poincare
(1854 - 1912) who strongly advocated the use of the word ‘solution’ and thus the
word ‘solution’ has found its deserved place in modern terminology. The name of
the ‘method of separation of variables’ is due to John Bernoulli (1667 - 1748),
a younger brother of James Bernoulli.
Application to geometric problems were also considered. It was again John
Bernoulli who first brought into light the intricate nature of differential equations.
In a letter to Leibnitz, dated May 20, 1715, he revealed the solutions of the
differential equation
x2 y″ = 2y,
which led to three types of curves, viz., parabolas, hyperbolas and a class of
cubic curves. This shows how varied the solutions of such innocent looking
differential equation can be. From the second half of the twentieth century attention
has been drawn to the investigation of this complicated nature of the solutions of
differential equations, under the heading ‘qualitative analysis of differential
equations’. Now-a-days, this has acquired prime importance being absolutely
necessary in almost all investigations.

VECTOR ALGEBRA
v In most sciences one generation tears down what another has built and what
one has established another undoes. In Mathematics alone each generation
builds a new story to the old structure. – HERMAN HANKEL v

10.1 Introduction
In our day to day life, we come across many queries such
as – What is your height? How should a football player hit
the ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe
that a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters,
a quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which
is a real number. Such quantities are called scalars.
However, an answer to the second query is a quantity (called
force) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and
direction (in which another player is positioned). Such
quantities are called vectors. In mathematics, physics and
engineering, we frequently come across with both types of
W.R. Hamilton
quantities, namely, scalar quantities such as length, mass,
(1805-1865)
time, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work,
money, voltage, density, resistance etc. and vector quantities like displacement, velocity,
acceleration, force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc.
In this chapter, we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various
operations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of
properties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors,
and lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above.

10.2 Some Basic Concepts
Let ‘l’ be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space. This line can be given
two directions by means of arrowheads. A line with one of these directions prescribed
is called a directed line (Fig 10.1 (i), (ii)).

VECTOR ALGEBRA

339

Fig 10.1

Now observe that if we restrict the line l to the line segment AB, then a magnitude
is prescribed on the line l with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed
line segment (Fig 10.1(iii)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as
direction.
Definition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector.
Notice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as
or
simply as , and read as ‘vector

’ or ‘vector ’.

The point A from where the vector
starts is called its initial point, and the
point B where it ends is called its terminal point. The distance between initial and
terminal points of a vector is called the magnitude (or length) of the vector, denoted as
|

|, or | |, or a. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector.

ANote Since the length is never negative, the notation | | < 0 has no meaning.
Position Vector
From Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system
(Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point P in space, having coordinates (x, y, z) with respect to
the origin O (0, 0, 0). Then, the vector
having O and P as its initial and terminal
points, respectively, is called the position vector of the point P with respect
to O. Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of
(or ) is given by
|

|=

x2 + y 2 + z2

In practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O
are denoted by , , , etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)).

Direction Cosines
Consider the position vector
of a point P(x, y, z) as in Fig 10.3. The angles α,
β, γ made by the vector with the positive directions of x, y and z-axes respectively,
are called its direction angles. The cosine values of these angles, i.e., cos α, cos β and
cos γ are called direction cosines of the vector , and usually denoted by l, m and n,
respectively.

10.3 Types of Vectors
Zero Vector A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector
(or null vector), and denoted as . Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction
as it has zero magnitude. Or, alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any
represent the zero vector,
direction. The vectors
Unit Vector A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector. The
unit vector in the direction of a given vector is denoted by â .
Coinitial Vectors Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial
vectors.
Collinear Vectors Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to
the same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions.
Equal Vectors Two vectors
are said to be equal, if they have the same
magnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written
as
.
Negative of a Vector A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector
(say,

), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector.

For example, vector

is negative of the vector

, and written as

=–

.

Remark The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its
parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are
called free vectors. Throughout this chapter, we will be dealing with free vectors only.

of 40 km, 30° west of south.

Now, consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a

vectors–one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the
velocity of the flow of river water. Under the simultaneous influence of these two
velocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a different velocity. To have a precise
idea about the effective speed and direction
(i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have
the following law of vector addition.
represented
If we have two vectors
by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram
in magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their
sum
is represented in magnitude and

through their common point. This is known as
the parallelogram law of vector addition.

10.5 Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar
Let be a given vector and λ a scalar. Then the product of the vector by the scalar
λ, denoted as λ , is called the multiplication of vector by the scalar λ. Note that, λ
is also a vector, collinear to the vector . The vector λ has the direction same (or
opposite) to that of vector according as the value of λ is positive (or negative). Also,
the magnitude of vector λ is | λ | times the magnitude of the vector , i.e.,

Now, consider the position vector
of a point P (x, y, z)
as in Fig 10.14. Let P1 be the foot of the perpendicular from P on the plane XOY.

10.6 Product of Two Vectors
So far we have studied about addition and subtraction of vectors. An other algebraic
operation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product. We may
recall that product of two numbers is a number, product of two matrices is again a
matrix. But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely,
multiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly,
multiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely, scalar (or dot)
product where the result is a scalar, and vector (or cross) product where the
result is a vector. Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have
found various applications in geometry, mechanics and engineering. In this section,
we will discuss these two types of products.

Historical Note
The word vector has been derived from a Latin word vectus, which means
“to carry”. The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800
when Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described
that how a complex number a + ib could be given a geometric interpretation with
the help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton
(1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a
directed line segment in his book Lectures on Quaternions (1853). Hamilton’s
method of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as:
a + biˆ + cjˆ + dkˆ, iˆ, ˆj , kˆ following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the
problem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must
mention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was
known much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek
philosopher, and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be
known that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding
them according to parallelogram law. The correct law for the composition of
forces, that forces add vectorially, had been discovered in the case of perpendicular
forces by Stevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of
geometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der Weeghconst
(“Principles of the Art of Weighing”), which caused a major breakthrough in the
development of mechanics. But it took another 200 years for the general concept
of vectors to form.
In the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and
mathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer, created
what we now know as vector analysis, essentially by separating the real (scalar)

MATHEMATICS

part of quaternion from its imaginary (vector) part. In 1881 and 1884, Gibbs
printed a treatise entitled Element of Vector Analysis. This book gave a systematic
and concise account of vectors. However, much of the credit for demonstrating
the applications of vectors is due to the D. Heaviside and P.G. Tait (1831-1901)
who contributed significantly to this subject.

THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY
v The moving power of mathematical invention is not
reasoning but imagination. – A. DEMORGAN v
11.1 Introduction
In Class XI, while studying Analytical Geometry in two
dimensions, and the introduction to three dimensional
geometry, we confined to the Cartesian methods only. In
the previous chapter of this book, we have studied some
basic concepts of vectors. We will now use vector algebra
to three dimensional geometry. The purpose of this
approach to 3-dimensional geometry is that it makes the
study simple and elegant*.
In this chapter, we shall study the direction cosines
and direction ratios of a line joining two points and also
discuss about the equations of lines and planes in space
under different conditions, angle between two lines, two
Leonhard Euler
planes, a line and a plane, shortest distance between two
(1707-1783)
skew lines and distance of a point from a plane. Most of
the above results are obtained in vector form. Nevertheless, we shall also translate
these results in the Cartesian form which, at times, presents a more clear geometric
and analytic picture of the situation.

11.2 Direction Cosines and Direction Ratios of a Line
From Chapter 10, recall that if a directed line L passing through the origin makes
angles α, β and γ with x, y and z-axes, respectively, called direction angles, then cosine
of these angles, namely, cos α, cos β and cos γ are called direction cosines of the
directed line L.
If we reverse the direction of L, then the direction angles are replaced by their supplements,
i.e.,
,
and
. Thus, the signs of the direction cosines are reversed.

MATHEMATICS

Fig 11.1

Note that a given line in space can be extended in two opposite directions and so it
has two sets of direction cosines. In order to have a unique set of direction cosines for
a given line in space, we must take the given line as a directed line. These unique
direction cosines are denoted by l, m and n.
Remark If the given line in space does not pass through the origin, then, in order to find
its direction cosines, we draw a line through the origin and parallel to the given line.
Now take one of the directed lines from the origin and find its direction cosines as two
parallel line have same set of direction cosines.
Any three numbers which are proportional to the direction cosines of a line are
called the direction ratios of the line. If l, m, n are direction cosines and a, b, c are
direction ratios of a line, then a = λl, b=λm and c = λn, for any nonzero λ ∈ R.

ANote Some authors also call direction ratios as direction numbers.

Let a, b, c be direction ratios of a line and let l, m and n be the direction cosines
(d.c’s) of the line. Then

For any line, if a, b, c are direction ratios of a line, then ka, kb, kc; k ≠ 0 is also a
set of direction ratios. So, any two sets of direction ratios of a line are also proportional.
Also, for any line there are infinitely many sets of direction ratios.
11.2.1 Direction cosines of a line passing through two points
Since one and only one line passes through two given points, we can determine the
direction cosines of a line passing through the given points P(x1, y1, z1) and Q(x2, y2, z2)
as follows (Fig 11.2 (a)).

Fig 11.2

Let l, m, n be the direction cosines of the line PQ and let it makes angles α, β and γ
with the x, y and z-axis, respectively.
Draw perpendiculars from P and Q to XY-plane to meet at R and S. Draw a
perpendicular from P to QS to meet at N. Now, in right angle triangle PNQ, ∠PQN= γ

Example 4 Find the direction cosines of x, y and z-axis.
Solution The x-axis makes angles 0°, 90° and 90° respectively with x, y and z-axis.
Therefore, the direction cosines of x-axis are cos 0°, cos 90°, cos 90° i.e., 1,0,0.
Similarly, direction cosines of y-axis and z-axis are 0, 1, 0 and 0, 0, 1 respectively.
Example 5 Show that the points A (2, 3, – 4), B (1, – 2, 3) and C (3, 8, – 11) are

Solution Direction ratios of line joining A and B are

The direction ratios of line joining B and C are
3 –1, 8 + 2, – 11 – 3, i.e., 2, 10, – 14.
It is clear that direction ratios of AB and BC are proportional, hence, AB is parallel
to BC. But point B is common to both AB and BC. Therefore, A, B, C are
collinear points.

11.3 Equation of a Line in Space
We have studied equation of lines in two dimensions in Class XI, we shall now study
the vector and cartesian equations of a line in space.
A line is uniquely determined if
(i) it passes through a given point and has given direction, or
(ii) it passes through two given points.

Let be the position vector of the given point A with respect to the origin O of the
rectangular coordinate system. Let l be the line which passes through the point A and
is parallel to a given vector . Let be the position vector of an arbitrary point P on the

11.5 Shortest Distance between Two Lines
If two lines in space intersect at a point,
then the shortest distance between them is
zero. Also, if two lines in space are parallel,
then the shortest distance between them
will be the perpendicular distance, i.e. the
length of the perpendicular drawn from a
point on one line onto the other line.
Further, in a space, there are lines which
are neither intersecting nor parallel. In fact,
such pair of lines are non coplanar and
are called skew lines. For example, let us
consider a room of size 1, 3, 2 units along
x, y and z-axes respectively Fig 11.5.

The line GE that goes diagonally across the ceiling and the line DB passes through
one corner of the ceiling directly above A and goes diagonally down the wall. These
lines are skew because they are not parallel and also never meet.
By the shortest distance between two lines we mean the join of a point in one line
with one point on the other line so that the length of the segment so obtained is the
smallest.
For skew lines, the line of the shortest distance will be perpendicular to both
the lines.

LINEAR PROGRAMMING
v The mathematical experience of the student is incomplete if he never had
the opportunity to solve a problem invented by himself. – G. POLYA v
12.1 Introduction
In earlier classes, we have discussed systems of linear
equations and their applications in day to day problems. In
Class XI, we have studied linear inequalities and systems
of linear inequalities in two variables and their solutions by
graphical method. Many applications in mathematics
involve systems of inequalities/equations. In this chapter,
we shall apply the systems of linear inequalities/equations
to solve some real life problems of the type as given below:
A furniture dealer deals in only two items–tables and
chairs. He has Rs 50,000 to invest and has storage space
of at most 60 pieces. A table costs Rs 2500 and a chair
Rs 500. He estimates that from the sale of one table, he
L. Kantorovich
can make a profit of Rs 250 and that from the sale of one
chair a profit of Rs 75. He wants to know how many tables and chairs he should buy
from the available money so as to maximise his total profit, assuming that he can sell all
the items which he buys.
Such type of problems which seek to maximise (or, minimise) profit (or, cost) form
a general class of problems called optimisation problems. Thus, an optimisation
problem may involve finding maximum profit, minimum cost, or minimum use of
resources etc.
A special but a very important class of optimisation problems is linear programming
problem. The above stated optimisation problem is an example of linear programming
problem. Linear programming problems are of much interest because of their wide
applicability in industry, commerce, management science etc.
In this chapter, we shall study some linear programming problems and their solutions
by graphical method only, though there are many other methods also to solve such
problems.

12.2 Linear Programming Problem and its Mathematical Formulation
We begin our discussion with the above example of furniture dealer which will further
lead to a mathematical formulation of the problem in two variables. In this example, we
observe
(i) The dealer can invest his money in buying tables or chairs or combination thereof.
Further he would earn different profits by following different investment
strategies.
(ii) There are certain overriding conditions or constraints viz., his investment is
limited to a maximum of Rs 50,000 and so is his storage space which is for a
maximum of 60 pieces.
Suppose he decides to buy tables only and no chairs, so he can buy 50000 ÷ 2500,
i.e., 20 tables. His profit in this case will be Rs (250 × 20), i.e., Rs 5000.
Suppose he chooses to buy chairs only and no tables. With his capital of Rs 50,000,
he can buy 50000 ÷ 500, i.e. 100 chairs. But he can store only 60 pieces. Therefore, he
is forced to buy only 60 chairs which will give him a total profit of Rs (60 × 75), i.e.,
Rs 4500.
There are many other possibilities, for instance, he may choose to buy 10 tables
and 50 chairs, as he can store only 60 pieces. Total profit in this case would be
Rs (10 × 250 + 50 × 75), i.e., Rs 6250 and so on.
We, thus, find that the dealer can invest his money in different ways and he would
earn different profits by following different investment strategies.
Now the problem is : How should he invest his money in order to get maximum
profit? To answer this question, let us try to formulate the problem mathematically.
12.2.1 Mathematical formulation of the problem
Let x be the number of tables and y be the number of chairs that the dealer buys.
Obviously, x and y must be non-negative, i.e.,
x≥0
y≥0

(Non-negative constraints)

... (1)
... (2)

The dealer is constrained by the maximum amount he can invest (Here it is
Rs 50,000) and by the maximum number of items he can store (Here it is 60).
Stated mathematically,

or

2500x + 500y ≤ 50000 (investment constraint)
5x + y ≤ 100

... (3)

and

x + y ≤ 60 (storage constraint)

... (4)

396

MATHEMATICS

The dealer wants to invest in such a way so as to maximise his profit, say, Z which
stated as a function of x and y is given by
Z = 250x + 75y (called objective function)
... (5)
Mathematically, the given problems now reduces to:
Maximise Z = 250x + 75y
subject to the constraints:
5x + y ≤ 100
x + y ≤ 60
x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0
So, we have to maximise the linear function Z subject to certain conditions determined
by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative. There are also some other
problems where we have to minimise a linear function subject to certain conditions
determined by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative. Such problems
are called Linear Programming Problems.
Thus, a Linear Programming Problem is one that is concerned with finding the
optimal value (maximum or minimum value) of a linear function (called objective
function) of several variables (say x and y), subject to the conditions that the variables
are non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called linear constraints).
The term linear implies that all the mathematical relations used in the problem are
linear relations while the term programming refers to the method of determining a
particular programme or plan of action.
Before we proceed further, we now formally define some terms (which have been
used above) which we shall be using in the linear programming problems:
Objective function Linear function Z = ax + by, where a, b are constants, which has
to be maximised or minimized is called a linear objective function.
In the above example, Z = 250x + 75y is a linear objective function. Variables x and
y are called decision variables.
Constraints The linear inequalities or equations or restrictions on the variables of a
linear programming problem are called constraints. The conditions x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 are
called non-negative restrictions. In the above example, the set of inequalities (1) to (4)
are constraints.
Optimisation problem A problem which seeks to maximise or minimise a linear
function (say of two variables x and y) subject to certain constraints as determined by
a set of linear inequalities is called an optimisation problem. Linear programming
problems are special type of optimisation problems. The above problem of investing a

LINEAR PROGRAMMING

given sum by the dealer in purchasing chairs and tables is an example of an optimisation
problem as well as of a linear programming problem.
We will now discuss how to find solutions to a linear programming problem. In this
chapter, we will be concerned only with the graphical method.
12.2.2 Graphical method of solving linear programming problems
In Class XI, we have learnt how to graph a system of linear inequalities involving two
variables x and y and to find its solutions graphically. Let us refer to the problem of
investment in tables and chairs discussed in Section 12.2. We will now solve this problem
graphically. Let us graph the constraints stated as linear inequalities:
5x + y ≤ 100

... (1)

x + y ≤ 60

... (2)

x≥0

... (3)

y≥0

... (4)

The graph of this system (shaded region) consists of the points common to all half
planes determined by the inequalities (1) to (4) (Fig 12.1). Each point in this region
represents a feasible choice open to the dealer for investing in tables and chairs. The
region, therefore, is called the feasible region for the problem. Every point of this
region is called a feasible solution to the problem. Thus, we have,
Feasible region The common region determined by all the constraints including
non-negative constraints x, y ≥ 0 of a linear programming problem is called the feasible
region (or solution region) for the problem. In Fig 12.1, the region OABC (shaded) is
the feasible region for the problem. The region other than feasible region is called an
infeasible region.
Feasible solutions Points within and on the
boundary of the feasible region represent
feasible solutions of the constraints. In
Fig 12.1, every point within and on the
boundary of the feasible region OABC
represents feasible solution to the problem.
For example, the point (10, 50) is a feasible
solution of the problem and so are the points
(0, 60), (20, 0) etc.
Any point outside the feasible region is
called an infeasible solution. For example,
the point (25, 40) is an infeasible solution of
the problem.

MATHEMATICS

Optimal (feasible) solution: Any point in the feasible region that gives the optimal
value (maximum or minimum) of the objective function is called an optimal solution.
Now, we see that every point in the feasible region OABC satisfies all the constraints
as given in (1) to (4), and since there are infinitely many points, it is not evident how
we should go about finding a point that gives a maximum value of the objective function
Z = 250x + 75y. To handle this situation, we use the following theorems which are
fundamental in solving linear programming problems. The proofs of these theorems
are beyond the scope of the book.
Theorem 1 Let R be the feasible region (convex polygon) for a linear programming
problem and let Z = ax + by be the objective function. When Z has an optimal value
(maximum or minimum), where the variables x and y are subject to constraints described
by linear inequalities, this optimal value must occur at a corner point* (vertex) of the
feasible region.
Theorem 2 Let R be the feasible region for a linear programming problem, and let
Z = ax + by be the objective function. If R is bounded**, then the objective function
Z has both a maximum and a minimum value on R and each of these occurs at a
corner point (vertex) of R.
Remark If R is unbounded, then a maximum or a minimum value of the objective
function may not exist. However, if it exists, it must occur at a corner point of R.
(By Theorem 1).
In the above example, the corner points (vertices) of the bounded (feasible) region
are: O, A, B and C and it is easy to find their coordinates as (0, 0), (20, 0), (10, 50) and
(0, 60) respectively. Let us now compute the values of Z at these points.
We have

A (20,0)

* A corner point of a feasible region is a point in the region which is the intersection of two boundary lines.
** A feasible region of a system of linear inequalities is said to be bounded if it can be enclosed within a
circle. Otherwise, it is called unbounded. Unbounded means that the feasible region does extend
indefinitely in any direction.

We observe that the maximum profit to the dealer results from the investment
strategy (10, 50), i.e. buying 10 tables and 50 chairs.
This method of solving linear programming problem is referred as Corner Point
Method. The method comprises of the following steps:
1. Find the feasible region of the linear programming problem and determine its
corner points (vertices) either by inspection or by solving the two equations of
the lines intersecting at that point.
2. Evaluate the objective function Z = ax + by at each corner point. Let M and m,
respectively denote the largest and smallest values of these points.
3. (i) When the feasible region is bounded, M and m are the maximum and
minimum values of Z.
(ii) In case, the feasible region is unbounded, we have:
4. (a) M is the maximum value of Z, if the open half plane determined by
ax + by > M has no point in common with the feasible region. Otherwise, Z
has no maximum value.
(b) Similarly, m is the minimum value of Z, if the open half plane determined by
ax + by < m has no point in common with the feasible region. Otherwise, Z
has no minimum value.
We will now illustrate these steps of Corner Point Method by considering some
examples:
Example 1 Solve the following linear programming problem graphically:
... (1)

Maximise Z = 4x + y
subject to the constraints:
x + y ≤ 50

... (2)

3x + y ≤ 90

... (3)

x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0

... (4)

Solution The shaded region in Fig 12.2 is the feasible region determined by the system
of constraints (2) to (4). We observe that the feasible region OABC is bounded. So,
we now use Corner Point Method to determine the maximum value of Z.
The coordinates of the corner points O, A, B and C are (0, 0), (30, 0), (20, 30) and
(0, 50) respectively. Now we evaluate Z at each corner point.

A, B and C are (0,5), (4,3) and (0,6) respectively. Now we evaluate Z = 200x + 500y
at these points.
Hence, minimum value of Z is 2300 attained at the point (4, 3)

bounded. The coordinates of the corner points A, B, C and D are (0, 10), (5, 5), (15,15)

We now find the minimum and maximum value of Z. From the table, we find that

The maximum value of Z on the feasible region occurs at the two corner points
C (15, 15) and D (0, 20) and it is 180 in each case.
Remark Observe that in the above example, the problem has multiple optimal solutions
at the corner points C and D, i.e. the both points produce same maximum value 180. In
such cases, you can see that every point on the line segment CD joining the two corner
points C and D also give the same maximum value. Same is also true in the case if the
two points produce same minimum value.

Solution First of all, let us graph the feasible region of the system of inequalities (2) to

We now evaluate Z at the corner points.

From this table, we find that – 300 is the smallest value of Z at the corner point
(6, 0). Can we say that minimum value of Z is – 300? Note that if the region would
have been bounded, this smallest value of Z is the minimum value of Z (Theorem 2).
But here we see that the feasible region is unbounded. Therefore, – 300 may or may
not be the minimum value of Z. To decide this issue, we graph the inequality
– 50x + 20y < – 300 (see Step 3(ii) of corner Point Method.)
i.e.,

– 5x + 2y < – 30

and check whether the resulting open half plane has points in common with feasible
region or not. If it has common points, then –300 will not be the minimum value of Z.
Otherwise, –300 will be the minimum value of Z.

As shown in the Fig 12.5, it has common points. Therefore, Z = –50 x + 20 y
has no minimum value subject to the given constraints.
In the above example, can you say whether z = – 50 x + 20 y has the maximum
value 100 at (0,5)? For this, check whether the graph of – 50 x + 20 y > 100 has points
in common with the feasible region. (Why?)

x+y≥8

3x + 5y ≤ 15

... (2)

x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0

... (3)

Solution Let us graph the inequalities (1) to (3) (Fig 12.6). Is there any feasible region?
Why is so?
From Fig 12.6, you can see that
there is no point satisfying all the
constraints simultaneously. Thus, the
problem is having no feasible region and
hence no feasible solution.
Remarks From the examples which we
have discussed so far, we notice some
general features of linear programming
problems:
(i) The feasible region is always a
convex region.
Fig 12.6
(ii) The maximum (or minimum)
solution of the objective function occurs at the vertex (corner) of the feasible
region. If two corner points produce the same maximum (or minimum) value
of the objective function, then every point on the line segment joining these
points will also give the same maximum (or minimum) value.

Summary

® A linear programming problem is one that is concerned with finding the optimal
value (maximum or minimum) of a linear function of several variables (called
objective function) subject to the conditions that the variables are
non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called linear constraints).
Variables are sometimes called decision variables and are non-negative.

Historical Note
In the World War II, when the war operations had to be planned to economise
expenditure, maximise damage to the enemy, linear programming problems
came to the forefront.
The first problem in linear programming was formulated in 1941 by the Russian
mathematician, L. Kantorovich and the American economist, F. L. Hitchcock,

In 1947, the American economist, G. B. Dantzig suggested an efficient method

L. Katorovich and American mathematical economist, T. C. Koopmans were

PROBABILITY
v The theory of probabilities is simply the Science of logic
quantitatively treated. – C.S. PEIRCE v
13.1 Introduction
In earlier Classes, we have studied the probability as a
measure of uncertainty of events in a random experiment.
We discussed the axiomatic approach formulated by
Russian Mathematician, A.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987)
and treated probability as a function of outcomes of the
experiment. We have also established equivalence between
the axiomatic theory and the classical theory of probability
in case of equally likely outcomes. On the basis of this
relationship, we obtained probabilities of events associated
with discrete sample spaces. We have also studied the
addition rule of probability. In this chapter, we shall discuss
the important concept of conditional probability of an event
given that another event has occurred, which will be helpful
in understanding the Bayes' theorem, multiplication rule of
Pierre de Fermat
probability and independence of events. We shall also learn
(1601-1665)
an important concept of random variable and its probability
distribution and also the mean and variance of a probability distribution. In the last
section of the chapter, we shall study an important discrete probability distribution
called Binomial distribution. Throughout this chapter, we shall take up the experiments
having equally likely outcomes, unless stated otherwise.

13.2 Conditional Probability
Uptill now in probability, we have discussed the methods of finding the probability of
events. If we have two events from the same sample space, does the information
about the occurrence of one of the events affect the probability of the other event? Let
us try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes
are equally likely to occur.
Consider the experiment of tossing three fair coins. The sample space of the
experiment is
S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}

to each sample point. Let
8
E be the event ‘at least two heads appear’ and F be the event ‘first coin shows tail’.
Then
E = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}
and
F = {THH, THT, TTH, TTT}
Therefore
P(E) = P ({HHH}) + P ({HHT}) + P ({HTH}) + P ({THH})
Since the coins are fair, we can assign the probability

and

+ + + = (Why ?)
8 8 8 8 2
P(F) = P ({THH}) + P ({THT}) + P ({TTH}) + P ({TTT})

Also

+ + + =
8 8 8 8 2
E ∩ F = {THH}

=

=

8
Now, suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e. F occurs, then what is
the probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F, we are
sure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered
while finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the
set S to its subset F for the event E. In other words, the additional information really
amounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new
random experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only
which are favourable to the occurrence of the event F.
Now, the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH.
with

P(E ∩ F) = P({THH}) =

Thus, Probability of E considering F as the sample space =

This probability of the event E is called the conditional probability of E given
that F has already occurred, and is denoted by P (E|F).

or

Probability of E given that the event F has occurred =

Note that the elements of F which favour the event E are the common elements of
E and F, i.e. the sample points of E ∩ F.
Thus

P(E|F) =

Thus, we can also write the conditional probability of E given that F has occurred as
P(E|F) =

Number of elementary eventsfavourable to E ∩ F
Number of elementaryevents which arefavourable to F
n (E ∩ F)
n (F)

Dividing the numerator and the denominator by total number of elementary events
of the sample space, we see that P(E|F) can also be written as

n(E ∩ F)
P(E ∩ F)
n(S)
=
P(E|F) =
n(F)
P(F)
n(S)

... (1)

Note that (1) is valid only when P(F) ≠ 0 i.e., F ≠ φ (Why?)
Thus, we can define the conditional probability as follows :
Definition 1 If E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a
random experiment, the conditional probability of the event E given that F has occurred,
i.e. P (E|F) is given by
P(E|F) =

P (E ∩ F)
provided P(F) ≠ 0
P(F)

13.2.1 Properties of conditional probability
Let E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have
Property 1 P (S|F) = P(F|F) = 1
We know that

Also

P(S|F) =

P (S ∩ F) P(F)

P(F|F) =

P (F ∩ F) P(F)

Thus
P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1
Property 2 If A and B are any two events of a sample space S and F is an event
of S such that P(F) ≠ 0, then
P((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A ∩ B)|F)

In particular, if A and B are disjoint events, then
P((A∪B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F)
We have
P((A ∪ B)|F) =

P[(A ∪ B) ∩ F]

When A and B are disjoint events, then
P ((A ∩ B)|F) = 0
⇒
P ((A ∪ B)|F) = P (A|F) + P(B|F)
Property 3 P (E′|F) = 1 − P (E|F)
From Property 1, we know that P(S|F) = 1
⇒
P (E ∪ E′|F) = 1
since S = E ∪ E′
since E and E′ are disjoint events
⇒
P(E|F) + P (E′|F) = 1
Thus,
P (E′|F) = 1 − P (E|F)
Let us now take up some examples.

For the conditional probability discussed above, we have considered the elementary events of the experiment to be equally likely and the corresponding definition of
the probability of an event was used. However, the same definition can also be used in
the general case where the elementary events of the sample space are not equally
likely, the probabilities P (E ∩ F) and P (F) being calculated accordingly. Let us take up
the following example.
Example 7 Consider the experiment of tossing a coin. If the coin shows head, toss it
again but if it shows tail, then throw a die. Find the
conditional probability of the event that ‘the die shows
a number greater than 4’ given that ‘there is at least
one tail’.
Solution The outcomes of the experiment can be
represented in following diagrammatic manner called
the ‘tree diagram’.
The sample space of the experiment may be
described as

Fig 13.1

S = {(H,H), (H,T), (T,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T,6)}
where (H, H) denotes that both the tosses result into
head and (T, i) denote the first toss result into a tail and
the number i appeared on the die for i = 1,2,3,4,5,6.

13.3 Multiplication Theorem on Probability
Let E and F be two events associated with a sample space S. Clearly, the set E ∩ F
denotes the event that both E and F have occurred. In other words, E ∩ F denotes the
simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F. The event E ∩ F is also written as EF.
Very often we need to find the probability of the event EF. For example, in the
experiment of drawing two cards one after the other, we may be interested in finding
the probability of the event ‘a king and a queen’. The probability of event EF is obtained
by using the conditional probability as obtained below :
We know that the conditional probability of event E given that F has occurred is
denoted by P(E|F) and is given by
P(E|F) =

P (E ∩ F)
, P (F) ≠ 0
P (F)

From this result, we can write
P (E ∩ F) = P (F) . P (E|F)
Also, we know that

or

P (F|E) =

P (F ∩ E)
,P (E) ≠ 0
P (E)

P (F|E) =

P (E ∩ F)
(since E ∩ F = F ∩ E)
P(E)

... (1)

Thus,
P(E ∩ F) = P(E). P(F|E)
.... (2)
Combining (1) and (2), we find that
P (E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E)
= P(F) P(E|F) provided P(E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0.
The above result is known as the multiplication rule of probability.
Let us now take up an example.
Example 8 An urn contains 10 black and 5 white balls. Two balls are drawn from the
urn one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both drawn
balls are black?
Solution Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn
are black. We have to find P (E ∩ F) or P (EF).

MATHEMATICS

Now

P (E) = P (black ball in first draw) =

10
15

Also given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there
are 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn. Therefore, the probability that the
second ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but
the conditional probability of F given that E has occurred.
i.e.

P(F|E) =

P (E ∩ F) = P (E) P (F|E)

Multiplication rule of probability for more than two events If E, F and G are
three events of sample space, we have
P (E ∩ F ∩ G) = P (E) P (F|E) P (G|(E ∩ F)) = P (E) P (F|E) P (G|EF)
Similarly, the multiplication rule of probability can be extended for four or
more events.
The following example illustrates the extension of multiplication rule of probability
for three events.
Example 9 Three cards are drawn successively, without replacement from a pack of
52 well shuffled cards. What is the probability that first two cards are kings and the
third card drawn is an ace?
Solution Let K denote the event that the card drawn is king and A be the event that
the card drawn is an ace. Clearly, we have to find P (KKA)
Now

P(K) =

4
52

Also, P (K|K) is the probability of second king with the condition that one king has
already been drawn. Now there are three kings in (52 − 1) = 51 cards.
Therefore

P(K|K) =

3
51

Lastly, P(A|KK) is the probability of third drawn card to be an ace, with the condition
that two kings have already been drawn. Now there are four aces in left 50 cards.

13.4 Independent Events
Consider the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of 52 playing cards, in which

P(F|E) =

the probability of occurrence of the event F.
Thus, E and F are two events such that the probability of occurrence of one of
them is not affected by occurrence of the other.
Such events are called independent events.

Definition 2 Two events E and F are said to be independent, if
P (F|E) = P (F) provided P (E) ≠ 0
and
P (E|F) = P (E) provided P (F) ≠ 0
Thus, in this definition we need to have P (E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0
Now, by the multiplication rule of probability, we have
P (E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F|E)
... (1)
If E and F are independent, then (1) becomes
P (E ∩ F) = P(E) . P(F)
... (2)
Thus, using (2), the independence of two events is also defined as follows:
Definition 3 Let E and F be two events associated with the same random experiment,
then E and F are said to be independent if
P (E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F)
Remarks
(i) Two events E and F are said to be dependent if they are not independent, i.e. if
P(E ∩ F ) ≠ P (E) . P (F)
(ii) Sometimes there is a confusion between independent events and mutually
exclusive events. Term ‘independent’ is defined in terms of ‘probability of events’
whereas mutually exclusive is defined in term of events (subset of sample space).
Moreover, mutually exclusive events never have an outcome common, but
independent events, may have common outcome. Clearly, ‘independent’ and
‘mutually exclusive’ do not have the same meaning.
In other words, two independent events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence
can not be mutually exclusive, and conversely, i.e. two mutually exclusive events
having nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be independent.
(iii) Two experiments are said to be independent if for every pair of events E and F,
where E is associated with the first experiment and F with the second experiment,
the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F when the
two experiments are performed is the product of P(E) and P(F) calculated
separately on the basis of two experiments, i.e., P (E ∩ F) = P (E) . P(F)
(iv) Three events A, B and C are said to be mutually independent, if
P (A ∩ B) = P (A) P (B)
P (A ∩ C) = P (A) P (C)
and

P (B ∩ C) = P (B) P(C)
P (A ∩ B ∩ C) = P (A) P (B) P (C)

If at least one of the above is not true for three given events, we say that the
events are not independent.
Example 10 A die is thrown. If E is the event ‘the number appearing is a multiple of
3’ and F be the event ‘the number appearing is even’ then find whether E and F are
independent ?
Solution We know that the sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Now
E = { 3, 6}, F = { 2, 4, 6} and E ∩ F = {6}

Example 11 An unbiased die is thrown twice. Let the event A be ‘odd number on the
first throw’ and B the event ‘odd number on the second throw’. Check the independence
of the events A and B.

A and B are independent events

or three tails’, F ‘at least two heads’ and G ‘at most two heads’. Of the pairs (E,F),
(E,G) and (F,G), which are independent? which are dependent?
Solution The sample space of the experiment is given by
S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
Clearly

E = {HHH, TTT}, F= {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}

and

Hence, the events (E and F) are independent, and the events (E and G) and
(F and G) are dependent.
Example 13 Prove that if E and F are independent events, then so are the events

Solution Since E and F are independent, we have
P (E ∩ F) = P(E) . P(F)

of at least one of A and B is given by 1– P(A′) P(B′)

13.5 Bayes' Theorem
Consider that there are two bags I and II. Bag I contains 2 white and 3 red balls and
Bag II contains 4 white and 5 red balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the
1
bags. We can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e. ) or probability of
2
drawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I). In
other words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour, if
we are given the bag from which the ball is drawn. But, can we find the probability that
the ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is
given? Here, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an
event occurred after it is known. Famous mathematician, John Bayes' solved the problem
of finding reverse probability by using conditional probability. The formula developed
by him is known as ‘Bayes theorem’ which was published posthumously in 1763.
Before stating and proving the Bayes' theorem, let us first take up a definition and
some preliminary results.
13.5.1 Partition of a sample space
A set of events E1, E2, ..., En is said to represent a partition of the sample space S if
(a) Ei ∩ Ej = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, ..., n

MATHEMATICS

(b) E1 ∪ Ε2 ∪ ... ∪ En= S and
(c) P(Ei) > 0 for all i = 1, 2, ..., n.
In other words, the events E1, E2, ..., En represent a partition of the sample space
S if they are pairwise disjoint, exhaustive and have nonzero probabilities.
As an example, we see that any nonempty event E and its complement E′ form a
partition of the sample space S since they satisfy E ∩ E′ = φ and E ∪ E′ = S.
From the Venn diagram in Fig 13.3, one can easily observe that if E and F are any
two events associated with a sample space S, then the set {E ∩ F′, E ∩ F, E′ ∩ F, E′ ∩ F′}
is a partition of the sample space S. It may be mentioned that the partition of a sample
space is not unique. There can be several partitions of the same sample space.
We shall now prove a theorem known as Theorem of total probability.
13.5.2 Theorem of total probability
Let {E1, E2,...,En} be a partition of the sample space S, and suppose that each of the
events E1, E2,..., En has nonzero probability of occurrence. Let A be any event associated
with S, then
P(A) = P(E1) P(A|E1) + P(E2) P(A|E2) + ... + P(En) P(A|En)
n

= ∑ P(E j ) P (A|E j )
j=1

Proof Given that E1, E2,..., En is a partition of the sample space S (Fig 13.4). Therefore,
S = E1 ∪ E2 ∪ ... ∪ En
... (1)
and
Ei ∩ Ej = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, ..., n
Now, we know that for any event A,
A=A∩S
= A ∩ (E1 ∪ E2 ∪ ... ∪ En)
Fig 13.4
= (A ∩ E1) ∪ (A ∩ E2) ∪ ...∪ (A ∩ En)
Also A ∩ Ei and A ∩ Ej are respectively the subsets of Ei and Ej . We know that
Ei and Ej are disjoint, for i ≠ j , therefore, A ∩ Ei and A ∩ Ej are also disjoint for all
i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, ..., n.
Thus,
P(A) = P [(A ∩ E1) ∪ (A ∩ E2)∪ .....∪ (A ∩ En)]
= P (A ∩ E1) + P (A ∩ E2) + ... + P (A ∩ En)
Now, by multiplication rule of probability, we have
P(A ∩ Ei) = P(Ei) P(A|Ei) as P (Ei) ≠ 0∀i = 1,2,..., n

Example 15 A person has undertaken a construction job. The probabilities are 0.65
that there will be strike, 0.80 that the construction job will be completed on time if there
is no strike, and 0.32 that the construction job will be completed on time if there is a
strike. Determine the probability that the construction job will be completed on time.
Solution Let A be the event that the construction job will be completed on time, and B
be the event that there will be a strike. We have to find P(A).
We have
P(B) = 0.65, P(no strike) = P(B′) = 1 − P(B) = 1 − 0.65 = 0.35
P(A|B) = 0.32, P(A|B′) = 0.80
Since events B and B′ form a partition of the sample space S, therefore, by theorem
on total probability, we have
P(A) = P(B) P(A|B) + P(B′) P(A|B′)
= 0.65 × 0.32 + 0.35 × 0.8
= 0.208 + 0.28 = 0.488
Thus, the probability that the construction job will be completed in time is 0.488.
We shall now state and prove the Bayes' theorem.

Remark The following terminology is generally used when Bayes' theorem is applied.
The events E1, E2, ..., En are called hypotheses.
The probability P(Ei) is called the priori probability of the hypothesis Ei
The conditional probability P(Ei |A) is called a posteriori probability of the
hypothesis Ei.
Bayes' theorem is also called the formula for the probability of "causes". Since the
Ei's are a partition of the sample space S, one and only one of the events Ei occurs (i.e.
one of the events Ei must occur and only one can occur). Hence, the above formula
gives us the probability of a particular Ei (i.e. a "Cause"), given that the event A has
occurred.
The Bayes' theorem has its applications in variety of situations, few of which are
illustrated in following examples.
Example 16 Bag I contains 3 red and 4 black balls while another Bag II contains 5 red
and 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags and it is found to
be red. Find the probability that it was drawn from Bag II.
Solution Let E1 be the event of choosing the bag I, E2 the event of choosing the bag II
and A be the event of drawing a red ball.

Solution Let E denote the event that the person selected is actually having HIV and A
the event that the person's HIV test is diagnosed as +ive. We need to find P(E|A).
Also E′ denotes the event that the person selected is actually not having HIV.
Clearly, {E, E′} is a partition of the sample space of all people in the population.

to be defective. What is the probability that it is manufactured by the machine B?
Solution Let events B1, B2, B3 be the following :
B1 : the bolt is manufactured by machine A
B2 : the bolt is manufactured by machine B
B3 : the bolt is manufactured by machine C
Clearly, B1, B2, B3 are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and hence, they
represent a partition of the sample space.
Let the event E be ‘the bolt is defective’.
The event E occurs with B1 or with B2 or with B3. Given that,
P(B1) = 25% = 0.25, P (B2) = 0.35 and P(B3) = 0.40
Again P(E|B1) = Probability that the bolt drawn is defective given that it is manufactured by machine A = 5% = 0.05

Solution Let E be the event that the man reports that six occurs in the throwing of the
die and let S1 be the event that six occurs and S2 be the event that six does not occur.
Then

P(S1) = Probability that six occurs =

P(E|S1) = Probability that the man reports that six occurs when six has
actually occurred on the die
P(S2) = Probability that six does not occur =

P(E|S2) = Probability that the man reports that six occurs when six has
not actually occurred on the die

Thus, by Bayes' theorem, we get
P(S1|E) = Probability that the report of the man that six has occurred is
actually a six

Remark A random variable is a real valued function whose domain is the sample
space of a random experiment.
For example, let us consider the experiment of tossing a coin two times in succession.
The sample space of the experiment is S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.

If X denotes the number of heads obtained, then X is a random variable and for
each outcome, its value is as given below :
X (HH) = 2, X (HT) = 1, X (TH) = 1, X (TT) = 0.
More than one random variables can be defined on the same sample space. For
example, let Y denote the number of heads minus the number of tails for each outcome
of the above sample space S.
Then
Y (HH) = 2, Y (HT) = 0, Y (TH) = 0, Y (TT) = – 2.
Thus, X and Y are two different random variables defined on the same sample
space S.

Example 24 If a machine is correctly set up, it produces 90% acceptable items. If it is
incorrectly set up, it produces only 40% acceptable items. Past experience shows that
80% of the set ups are correctly done. If after a certain set up, the machine produces
2 acceptable items, find the probability that the machine is correctly setup.
Solution Let A be the event that the machine produces 2 acceptable items.
Also let B1 represent the event of correct set up and B2 represent the event of
incorrect setup.
Now

P(B1) = 0.8, P(B2) = 0.2
P(A|B1) = 0.9 × 0.9 and P(A|B2) = 0.4 × 0.4

The salient features of the chapter are –

is given by P(E | F) =

P (E ∩ F)
, P(F) ≠ 0
P(F)

® 0 ≤ P (E|F) ≤ 1,

P (E′|F) = 1 – P (E|F)
P ((E ∪ F)|G) = P (E|G) + P (F|G) – P ((E ∩ F)|G)
® P (E ∩ F) = P (E) P (F|E), P (E) ≠ 0
P (E ∩ F) = P (F) P (E|F), P (F) ≠ 0
® If E and F are independent, then
P (E ∩ F) = P (E) P (F)
P (E|F) = P (E), P (F) ≠ 0
P (F|E) = P (F), P(E) ≠ 0
® Theorem of total probability
Let {E1, E2, ...,En) be a partition of a sample space and suppose that each of
E1, E2, ..., En has nonzero probability. Let A be any event associated with S,
then
P(A) = P(E1) P (A|E1) + P (E2) P (A|E2) + ... + P (En) P(A|En)

Historical Note
The earliest indication on measurement of chances in game of dice appeared
in 1477 in a commentary on Dante's Divine Comedy. A treatise on gambling
named liber de Ludo Alcae, by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published
posthumously in 1663. In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases
for each event when two dice are thrown.
Galileo (1564-1642) gave casual remarks concerning the correct evaluation
of chance in a game of three dice. Galileo analysed that when three dice are
thrown, the sum of the number that appear is more likely to be 10 than the sum 9,
because the number of cases favourable to 10 are more than the number of
cases for the appearance of number 9.
Apart from these early contributions, it is generally acknowledged that the
true origin of the science of probability lies in the correspondence between two
great men of the seventeenth century, Pascal (1623-1662) and Pierre de Fermat
(1601-1665). A French gambler, Chevalier de Metre asked Pascal to explain
some seeming contradiction between his theoretical reasoning and the
observation gathered from gambling. In a series of letters written around 1654,
Pascal and Fermat laid the first foundation of science of probability. Pascal solved
the problem in algebraic manner while Fermat used the method of combinations.
Great Dutch Scientist, Huygens (1629-1695), became acquainted with the
content of the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat and published a first
book on probability, "De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae" containing solution of many
interesting rather than difficult problems on probability in games of chances.
The next great work on probability theory is by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705),
in the form of a great book, "Ars Conjectendi" published posthumously in 1713
by his nephew, Nicholes Bernoulli. To him is due the discovery of one of the most
important probability distribution known as Binomial distribution. The next
remarkable work on probability lies in 1993. A. N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) is
credited with the axiomatic theory of probability. His book, ‘Foundations of
probability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is
considered a ‘classic!’.
