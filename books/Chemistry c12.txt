FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on
the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system
of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own
learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.
Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one
of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat
children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of
knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as
rigour in implementing the annual calender so that the required number
of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for
teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook
proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather
than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to
address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and
reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for
child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee

advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and
the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor B. L. Khandelwal for guiding
the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the
development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for
making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and
organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their
resources, material and personnel. As an organisation committed to systemic

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOKS
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises
reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential
learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has
undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes.
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes
have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
•

Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in
the same class

•

Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same
subject

•

Difficulty level

•

Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through
self-learning or peer-learning

•

Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the
changes given above.

PREFACE
Chemistry has made a profound impact on the society. It is intimately linked
to the well-being of human kind. The rate of advancements in chemistry is so
high that curriculum developers continuously look for strategies to cope with
these advancements. Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future
leaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is
a sincere effort in this direction.
The structure of the textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen
Units. Although the titles of various Units indicate a sort of
compartmentalisation into physical, inorganic and organic chemistry, readers
will find that these sub-disciplines have been intermingled, at least to a certain
extent, to have a unified approach to the subject. The approach of presentation
of the subject matter discourages students from rote memorisation. The subject
has in fact, been organised around the laws and principles of chemistry. As
students master these laws and principles, they will soon get to the point
where they can predict much of what will come.
Efforts have been directed towards making the subject stimulating and
exciting by references to the historical developments and its usefulness to our
lives, wherever appropriate. The text is well illustrated with examples from
surrounding environment to facilitate grasping of the qualitative and
quantitative aspects of the concept easily. Physical data are given in SI units
throughout the book to make comparison of various properties easier. IUPAC
system of nomenclature has been followed along with the common system.
Structural formulae of chemical compounds showing functional/coordinating
groups in different colours are drawn using electronic system. Each Unit has
a good number of examples, as illustrations, with their solutions and some
intext questions, the answers of some of which are given at the end of the Unit.
The end of Unit exercises are designed to apply important principles and
provoke thinking process to solve them. Answers of some of these exercises
are given at the end of the book.
A variety of materials, e.g., biographical sketches of some scientists,
additional information related to a particular topic, etc., is given in boxes with
a deep yellow coloured bar. This boxed material with a 'deep yellow bar' is to
bring additional life to the topic. However, it is non-evaluative. The structures
of some of the more complex compounds incorporated in the book are for
understanding their chemistry. As their reproduction would lead to
memorisation, it is also a non-evaluative portion of the text.
The information part has been significantly reduced and, wherever possible,
it has been substantiated with facts. However, it is necessary for students to

vii

Rationalised 2023-24

be aware of commercially important chemicals, their process of manufacture
and sources of raw materials. This leads to descriptive material in the book.
Attempts have been made to make descriptions of such compounds interesting
by considering their structures and reactivity. Thermodynamics, kinetics and
electrochemical aspects have been applied to chemical reactions which should
be beneficial to students for understanding why a particular reaction happened
and why a particular property is exhibited by the product. There is currently
great awareness of environmental and energy issues which are directly related
to chemistry. Such issues have been highlighted and dealt with at appropriate
places in the book.
A team of experts constituted by the NCERT has developed the manuscript
of the book. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the valuable contribution
of all the members of this team. I also acknowledge the valuable and relentless
contribution of the editors in bringing the book to the present shape. I also
acknowledge with thanks the dedicated efforts and valuable contribution of
Professor Brahm Parkash, who not only coordinated the entire programme
but also actively involved in writing and editing of this book. Thanks are also
due to the participating teachers and subject experts of the review workshop
for their contribution, which has helped us to make the book learner friendly.
Also, I thank the technical and administrative staff of the NCERT for their
support in the entire process.
The team of this textbook development programme hopes that the book
stimulates its readers and makes them feel the excitement and fascination for
this subject. Efforts have been made to bring out this book error-free.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that in such a book of complexity, there could
inevitably be occasional errors. It will always be a pleasure to hear about
them from readers to take necessary steps to rectify them.

Objectives

Solutions

After studying this Unit, you will be
able to
·

describe the formation of different
types of solutions;

·

express concentration of solution
in different units;

·

state and explain Henry’s law and
Raoult’s law;

·

distinguish between ideal and
non-ideal solutions;

·

explain deviations of real solutions
from Raoult’s law;

·

describe colligative properties of
solutions and correlate these with
molar masses of the solutes;

·

explain abnormal colligative
properties exhibited by some
solutes in solutions.

1.1 Types of
Solutions

Almost all processes in body occur in some kind of liquid solutions.

In normal life we rarely come across pure substances.
Most of these are mixtures containing two or more pure
substances. Their utility or importance in life depends
on their composition. For example, the properties of
brass (mixture of copper and zinc) are quite different
from those of German silver (mixture of copper, zinc
and nickel) or bronze (mixture of copper and tin);
1 part per million (ppm) of fluoride ions in water
prevents tooth decay, while 1.5 ppm causes the tooth
to become mottled and high concentrations of fluoride
ions can be poisonous (for example, sodium fluoride is
used in rat poison); intravenous injections are always
dissolved in water containing salts at particular ionic
concentrations that match with blood plasma
concentrations and so on.
In this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid
solutions and their formation. This will be followed by
studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour
pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with
types of solutions and then various alternatives in
which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in
liquid solution.

Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two
components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition
and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the
component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent.
Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or
more components present in the solution other than solvent are called
solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e.,

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm
Rationalised 2023-24

consisting of two components). Here each component may be
solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1.

1.2 Expressing
Concentration
of Solutions

Common Examples

Composition of a solution can be described by expressing its
concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively
or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the
solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute)
or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of
solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to
lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description
of the solution.
There are several ways by which we can describe the concentration
of the solution quantitatively.
(i) Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a
solution is defined as:
Mass % of a component
=

Mass of the component in the solution
 100
Total mass of the solution

(1.1)

For example, if a solution is described by 10% glucose in water by
mass, it means that 10 g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water
resulting in a 100 g solution. Concentration described by mass
percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications.
For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass
percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water.
(ii) Volume percentage (V/V): The volume percentage is defined as:
Volume of the component
 100
Volume % of a component =
Total volume of solution
(1.2)
Chemistry

2

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm
Rationalised 2023-24

For example, 10% ethanol solution in water means that 10 mL
of ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of
the solution is 100 mL. Solutions containing liquids are commonly
expressed in this unit. For example, a 35% (v/v) solution of
ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the
engine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing
point of water to 255.4K (–17.6°C).
(iii) Mass by volume percentage (w/V): Another unit which is
commonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by
volume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in
100 mL of the solution.
(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it
is convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm)
and is defined as:
Parts per million =
Number of parts of the component
×106 (1.3)
Total number of parts of all components of the solution

As in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can
also be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to
volume. A litre of sea water (which weighs 1030 g) contains about
–3
6 × 10 g of dissolved oxygen (O2). Such a small concentration is
6
also expressed as 5.8 g per 10 g (5.8 ppm) of sea water. The
concentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed
–1
in terms of mg mL or ppm.
(v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is x and
subscript used on the right hand side of x denotes the component.
It is defined as:
Mole fraction of a component =

Number of moles of the component
Total number of moles of all the compone nts

(1.4)

For example, in a binary mixture, if the number of moles of A and B are
nA and nB respectively, the mole fraction of A will be
xA =

nA
n A  nB

(1.5)

For a solution containing i number of components, we have:
xi =

ni
=
n 1  n 2  .......  n i

ni

(1.6)

 ni

It can be shown that in a given solution sum of all the mole
fractions is unity, i.e.
x1 + x2 + .................. + xi = 1
(1.7)
Mole fraction unit is very useful in relating some physical properties
of solutions, say vapour pressure with the concentration of the
solution and quite useful in describing the calculations involving
gas mixtures.

Solutions

Example 1.1 Calculate the mole fraction of ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) in a solution
containing 20% of C2H6O2 by mass.

Solution Assume that we have 100 g of solution (one can start with any amount of
solution because the results obtained will be the same). Solution will
contain 20 g of ethylene glycol and 80 g of water.
Molar mass of C2H6O2 = 12 × 2 + 1 × 6 + 16 × 2 = 62 g mol–1.
Moles of C2H6O2 =
Moles of water =

20 g
= 0.322 mol
62 g mol 1

80 g
= 4.444 mol
18 g mol -1

x glycol 

moles of C2 H6 O2
moles of C2 H6 O2  moles of H2O



0.322 mol
= 0.068
0.322 mol  4.444 mol

Similarly, x water 

4.444 mol
 0.932
0.322 mol  4.444 mol

Mole fraction of water can also be calculated as: 1 – 0.068 = 0.932

(vi) Molarity: Molarity (M) is defined as number of moles of solute dissolved
in one litre (or one cubic decimetre) of solution,
Molarity 

Moles of solute
Volume of solution in litre

(1.8)

For example, 0.25 mol L–1 (or 0.25 M) solution of NaOH means that
0.25 mol of NaOH has been dissolved in one litre (or one cubic decimetre).

Example 1.2

Calculate the molarity of a solution containing 5 g of NaOH in 450 mL
solution.

Solution Moles of NaOH =

5g
= 0.125 mol
40 g mol-1

Volume of the solution in litres = 450 mL / 1000 mL L-1
Using equation (2.8),
Molarity =

0.125 mol × 1000 mL L–1
= 0.278 M
450 mL

= 0.278 mol L–1
= 0.278 mol dm–3

(vii) Molality: Molality (m) is defined as the number of moles of the solute
per kilogram (kg) of the solvent and is expressed as:
Molality (m) =

Moles of solute
Mass of solvent in kg

(1.9)

–1

For example, 1.00 mol kg (or 1.00 m) solution of KCl means that
1 mol (74.5 g) of KCl is dissolved in 1 kg of water.
Each method of expressing concentration of the solutions has its
own merits and demerits. Mass %, ppm, mole fraction and molality
are independent of temperature, whereas molarity is a function of
temperature. This is because volume depends on temperature
and the mass does not.
Calculate molality of 2.5 g of ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) in 75 g of benzene.

Example 1.3

Molar mass of C2H4O2: 12 × 2 + 1 × 4 + 16 × 2 = 60 g mol–1

Solution

Moles of C2H4O2 =

2.5 g
= 0.0417 mol
60 g mol −1

Mass of benzene in kg = 75 g/1000 g kg–1 = 75 × 10–3 kg

1.3 Solubility

Solubility of a substance is its maximum amount that can be dissolved
in a specified amount of solvent at a specified temperature. It depends
upon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and
pressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid
or a gas in a liquid.

1.3.1 Solubility of
a Solid in a
Liquid

Every solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. While sodium chloride
and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do
not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in
benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that
polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in nonpolar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the
intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like
dissolves like.
When a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves
and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as
dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute
particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as
crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the
same rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going
into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and
a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached.
Solute + Solvent ⇌ Solution

(1.10)

At this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain
constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure.
Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents.
Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same
temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An
unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at
the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium
with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the
maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent.
Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility.
Earlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into
another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these
variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also
control this phenomenon.
Effect of temperature

The solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature
changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This,
being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In
general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is
endothermic (Dsol H > 0), the solubility should increase with rise in
temperature and if it is exothermic (Dsol H < 0) the solubility should
decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally.
Effect of pressure

Pressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in
liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible
and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure.
1.3.2 Solubility of
a Gas in a
Liquid

Chemistry

Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent
in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On
the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water.
Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and

temperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure.
For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in
Fig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous
system at pressure p and temperature T. Assume this system to be in
a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of
gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same.
Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the
gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of
gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate
at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to
enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium
is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the
solution and thus its solubility increases.
Henry was the first to give a
quantitative relation between
pressure and solubility of a gas in
a solvent which is known as
Henry’s law. The law states that
at a constant temperature, the
solubility of a gas in a liquid is
directly proportional to the
partial pressure of the gas
present above the surface of
liquid or solution. Dalton, a
contemporary of Henry, also
Fig. 1.1: Effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas. The concluded independently that the
concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to the solubility of a gas in a liquid
pressure on the gas above the solution.
solution is a function of partial
pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in
the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be
said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is
proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over
the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry’s
law states that “the partial pressure of the gas in
vapour phase (p) is proportional to the mole fraction
of the gas (x) in the solution” and is expressed as:

Fig. 1.2: Experimental results for
the solubility of HCl gas in
cyclohexane at 293 K. The
slope of the line is the
Henry’s Law constant, KH.

p = KH x
(1.11)
Here KH is the Henry’s law constant. If we draw a
graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole
fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot
of the type as shown in Fig. 1.2.
Different gases have different KH values at the same
temperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that KH is a
function of the nature of the gas.
It is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the
value of KH at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility
of the gas in the liquid. It can be seen from Table 1.2
that KH values for both N2 and O2 increase with increase
of temperature indicating that the solubility of gases

Example 1.4 If N2 gas is bubbled through water at 293 K, how many millimoles of N2

gas would dissolve in 1 litre of water? Assume that N2 exerts a partial
pressure of 0.987 bar. Given that Henry’s law constant for N2 at 293 K is
76.48 kbar.

Solution The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution.
The mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying
Henry’s law. Thus:

Henry’s law finds several applications in industry and explains some
biological phenomena. Notable among these are:
· To increase the solubility of CO2 in soft drinks and soda water, the
bottle is sealed under high pressure.
· Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases
while breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure
increases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. When the
divers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This
releases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles
of nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical
condition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life.

To avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations
of nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled
with air diluted with helium (11.7% helium, 56.2% nitrogen and
32.1% oxygen).
· At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at
the ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the
blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low
blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think
clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia.
Effect of Temperature

Solubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. When
dissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process
of dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat
is evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that
dissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must
follow Le Chatelier’s Principle. As dissolution is an exothermic
process, the solubility should decrease with increase of
temperature.

Liquid
Solutions

Liquid solutions are formed when solvent is a liquid. The solute can be
a gas, a liquid or a solid. Solutions of gases in liquids have already
been discussed in Section 1.3.2. In this Section, we shall discuss the
solutions of liquids and solids in a liquid. Such solutions may contain
one or more volatile components. Generally, the liquid solvent is volatile.
The solute may or may not be volatile. We shall discuss the properties
of only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two
components, namely, the solutions of (i) liquids in liquids and (ii) solids
in liquids.

1.4.1 Vapour

LiquidLiquid
Solutions

Let us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the
two components as 1 and 2. When taken in a closed vessel, both the
components would evaporate and eventually an equilibrium would be
established between vapour phase and the liquid phase. Let the total
vapour pressure at this stage be ptotal and p1 and p2 be the partial
vapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These
partial pressures are related to the mole fractions x1 and x2 of the two
components 1 and 2 respectively.
The French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult (1886) gave the
quantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as
the Raoult’s law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids,

the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution
is directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution.
Thus, for component 1

temperature.
Similarly, for component 2

where p2 represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2.
According to Dalton’s law of partial pressures, the total pressure
( p total ) over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the
partial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as:
ptotal = p1 + p2
(1.14)
Substituting the values of p1 and p2, we get
ptotal = x1 p10 + x2 p20
= (1 – x2) p10 + x2 p20

(1.15)

= p10 + (p20 – p10) x2

(1.16)

Following conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16).
(i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole
fraction of any one component.
(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the
mole fraction of component 2.
(iii) Depending on the vapour pressures
of the pure components 1 and 2,
total vapour pressure over the
solution decreases or increases with
the increase of the mole fraction of
component 1.

fraction of an ideal solution at constant
temperature. The dashed lines I and II
represent the partial pressure of the

pressure is given by line marked III in the

A plot of p1 or p2 versus the mole
fractions x1 and x2 for a solution gives a
linear plot as shown in Fig. 1.3. These
lines (I and II) pass through the points for
which x 1 and x 2 are equal to unity.
Similarly the plot (line III) of ptotal versus
x2 is also linear (Fig. 1.3). The minimum

= p10 + (p20 – p10) x2 = 200 + (415 – 200) × 0.688
= 200 + 147.9 = 347.9 mm Hg

(ii) Using the relation (2.19), yi = pi/ptotal, we can calculate the mole
fraction of the components in gas phase (yi).
pCH2Cl2 = 0.688 × 415 mm Hg = 285.5 mm Hg

pCHCl3 = 0.312 × 200 mm Hg = 62.4 mm Hg
yCH2Cl2 = 285.5 mm Hg/347.9 mm Hg = 0.82
yCHCl3 = 62.4 mm Hg/347.9 mm Hg = 0.18
0

Note: Since, CH2Cl2 is a more volatile component than CHCl3, [ p CH2 Cl2 =

415 mm Hg and p CHCl3 = 200 mm Hg] and the vapour phase is also richer
in CH2Cl2 [ yCH2Cl2 = 0.82 and y CHCl3 = 0.18], it may thus be concluded
that at equilibrium, vapour phase will be always rich in the component
which is more volatile.

1.4.2 Raoult’s
Law as a
special case
of Henry’s
Law

According to Raoult’s law, the vapour pressure of a volatile component
in a given solution is given by pi = xi pi0. In the solution of a gas in a
liquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas and
we have already seen that its solubility is given by Henry’s law which
states that
p = KH x.
If we compare the equations for Raoult’s law and Henry’s law, it
can be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas
is directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the
0
proportionality constant KH differs from p1 . Thus, Raoult’s law becomes
0
a special case of Henry’s law in which KH becomes equal to p1 .

1.4.3 Vapour
Pressure of
Solutions of
Solids in
Liquids

Another important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in
liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in
water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some
physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of
pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given
temperature vapourise and under
equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted
by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid
phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)].
In a pure liquid the entire surface is
occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a
non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to
give a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour
pressure of the solution is solely from the
solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the
solution at a given temperature is found to
be lower than the vapour pressure of the
pure solvent at the same temperature. In
Fig. 1.4: Decrease in the vapour pressure of the the solution, the surface has both solute and
solvent on account of the presence of solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the
solute in the solvent (a) evaporation of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets
molecules of the solvent from its surface reduced. Consequently, the number of
is denoted by , (b) in a solution, solute
solvent molecules escaping from the surface
particles have been denoted by and they
is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour
also occupy part of the surface area.
pressure is also reduced.
The decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the
quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of
its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by
adding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that
produced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at
the same temperature.
Raoult’s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution
the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the
solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction.
In a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by
2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are
present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let p1 be

(Fig. 1.5).

1 . 5 Ideal and Nonideal Solutions

Liquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal
solutions on the basis of Raoult’s law.

1.5.1 Ideal
Solutions

The solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of
concentration are known as ideal solutions. The ideal solutions have
two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the
pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume
of mixing is also zero, i.e.,
DmixH = 0,
DmixV = 0
(1.21)
It means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components
are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of
volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of
the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and
B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will
be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition
to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present.
If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are
nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal
solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly
ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane
and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category.

1.5.2 Non-ideal
Solutions

When a solution does not obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of
concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure
of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by
Raoult’s law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive
deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult’s
law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions
for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6.
The cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the
molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult’s law, A-B
interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case
the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules
are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent
molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will
find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour

pressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone
behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded.
On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and
break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of
interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult’s law
[Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to
acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are
weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and
solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation.
In case of negative deviations from Raoult’s law, the intermolecular
attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between
A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative
deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline.
In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic
proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the
respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar
molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone
forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult’s law.
This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen
bond with acetone molecule as shown.

This decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each
component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting
in negative deviation from Raoult’s law [Fig. 1.6. (b)].
Some liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures
having the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at
a constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the
components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes
called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling
azeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from
Raoult’s law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition.
Chemistry

For example, ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars)
on fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately 95%
by volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope
composition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same
composition, and no further separation occurs.
The solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult’s law
form maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid
and water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has
the approximate composition, 68% nitric acid and 32% water by mass,
with a boiling point of 393.5 K.

1.6 Colligative
Properties and
Determination
of Molar Mass

We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of solution
decreases when a non-volatile solute is added to a volatile solvent.
There are many properties of solutions which are connected with this
decrease of vapour pressure. These are: (1) relative lowering of vapour
pressure of the solvent (2) depression of freezing point of the solvent
(3) elevation of boiling point of the solvent and (4) osmotic pressure of
the solution. All these properties depend on the number of solute
particles irrespective of their nature relative to the total number
of particles present in the solution. Such properties are called
colligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare
means to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these
properties one by one.

1.6.1 Relative
Lowering of
Vapour
Pressure

We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in
solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the
lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the
solute particles and it is independent of their identity. The equation (1.20)
given in Section 1.4.3 establishes a relation between vapour pressure of
the solution, mole fraction and vapour pressure of the solvent, i.e.,
p1 = x1 p10
(1.22)
The reduction in the vapour pressure of solvent (Dp1) is given as:
Dp1 = p10 – p1 = p10 – p10 x1
(1.23)
= p10 (1 – x1)
Knowing that x2 = 1 – x1, equation (1.23) reduces to
Dp 1 = x2 p10
(1.24)
In a solution containing several non-volatile solutes, the lowering of the
vapour pressure depends on the sum of the mole fraction of different solutes.
Equation (1.24) can be written as

Example 1.6 The vapour pressure of pure benzene at a certain temperature is 0.850
bar. A non-volatile, non-electrolyte solid weighing 0.5 g when added to
39.0 g of benzene (molar mass 78 g mol-1). Vapour pressure of the solution,
then, is 0.845 bar. What is the molar mass of the solid substance?

Solution The various quantities known to us are as follows:
p10 = 0.850 bar; p = 0.845 bar; M1 = 78 g mol–1; w2 = 0.5 g; w1 = 39 g
Substituting these values in equation (2.28), we get

0.5 g × 78 g mol
0.850 bar – 0.845 bar
=
M 2 × 39 g
0.850 bar

Therefore, M2 = 170 g mol–1

1.6.2 Elevation of
Boiling Point

Chemistry

The vapour pressure of a liquid increases with increase of
temperature. It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure
is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at
373.15 K (100° C) because at this temperature the vapour pressure
of water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last
section that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence
of non-volatile solute. Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure
of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For
example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is
less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution
boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by
raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of
the pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is

16

Rationalised 2023-24

always higher than that of the boiling point of
the pure solvent in which the solution is prepared
as shown in Fig. 1.7. Similar to lowering of vapour
pressure, the elevation of boiling point also
depends on the number of solute molecules
rather than their nature. A solution of 1 mol of
sucrose in 1000 g of water boils at 373.52 K at
one atmospheric pressure.

or

Let Tb0 be the boiling point of pure solvent and

Tb be the boiling point of solution. The increase in
the boiling point T b  Tb  Tb0 is known as
elevation of boiling point.
Fig. 1.7: The vapour pressure curve for
solution lies below the curve for pure
water. The diagram shows that DTb
denotes the elevation of boiling
point of a solvent in solution.

Experiments have shown that for dilute
solutions the elevation of boiling point (DTb) is
directly proportional to the molal concentration of
the solute in a solution. Thus
or

DTb µ m

(1.29)

DTb = Kb m

(1.30)

Here m (molality) is the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 kg
of solvent and the constant of proportionality, Kb is called Boiling Point
Elevation Constant or Molal Elevation Constant (Ebullioscopic
Constant). The unit of Kb is K kg mol-1. Values of Kb for some common
solvents are given in Table 1.3. If w2 gram of solute of molar mass M2
is dissolved in w1 gram of solvent, then molality, m of the solution is
given by the expression:
m

=

w2/M2
1000 × w2
=
w1/1000
M 2 × w1

(1.31)

Substituting the value of molality in equation (1.30) we get
DT b =

K b × 1000 × w2
M 2 × w1

(1.32)

M2 =

1000 × w2 × K b
Tb × w1

(1.33)

Thus, in order to determine M2, molar mass of the solute, known
mass of solute in a known mass of the solvent is taken and DTb is
determined experimentally for a known solvent whose Kb value is known.
18 g of glucose, C6H12O6, is dissolved in 1 kg of water in a saucepan. Example 1.7
At what temperature will water boil at 1.013 bar? Kb for water is 0.52
K kg mol-1.
Moles of glucose = 18 g/ 180 g mol–1 = 0.1 mol
Number of kilograms of solvent = 1 kg
Thus molality of glucose solution = 0.1 mol kg-1
For water, change in boiling point

Solutions

DTb = Kb × m = 0.52 K kg mol–1 × 0.1 mol kg–1 = 0.052 K
Since water boils at 373.15 K at 1.013 bar pressure, therefore, the
boiling point of solution will be 373.15 + 0.052 = 373.202 K.

Example 1.8 The boiling point of benzene is 353.23 K. When 1.80 g of a non-volatile
solute was dissolved in 90 g of benzene, the boiling point is raised to
354.11 K. Calculate the molar mass of the solute. Kb for benzene is 2.53
K kg mol–1

Solution The elevation (DTb) in the boiling point = 354.11 K – 353. 23 K = 0.88 K
Substituting these values in expression (2.33) we get

2.53 K kg mol –1 × 1.8 g × 1000 g kg –1
= 58 g mol–1
0.88 K × 90 g
Therefore, molar mass of the solute, M2 = 58 g mol–1

1.6.3 Depression The lowering of vapour pressure of a solution causes a lowering of the
of Freezing freezing point compared to that of the pure solvent (Fig. 1.8). We know
Point
that at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase is in dynamic
equilibrium with the liquid phase. Thus, the
freezing point of a substance may be defined as
the temperature at which the vapour pressure of
the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its
vapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution
will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the
vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is
clear from Fig. 1.8. According to Raoult’s law,
when a non-volatile solid is added to the solvent
its vapour pressure decreases and now it would
become equal to that of solid solvent at lower
temperature. Thus, the freezing point of the
solvent decreases.
Let Tf0 be the freezing point of pure solvent

of the freezing point of a solvent in
a solution.

and Tf be its freezing point when non-volatile
solute is dissolved in it. The decrease in freezing
point.

Tf  Tf0  Tf is known as depression in
freezing point.

Similar to elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point (DTf)
for dilute solution (ideal solution) is directly proportional to molality,
m of the solution. Thus,
DTf
or

µ m

DTf = Kf m

(1.34)

The proportionality constant, Kf, which depends on the nature of the
solvent is known as Freezing Point Depression Constant or Molal

Depression Constant or Cryoscopic Constant. The unit of Kf is K kg
mol-1. Values of Kf for some common solvents are listed in Table 1.3.
If w2 gram of the solute having molar mass as M2, present in w1
gram of solvent, produces the depression in freezing point DTf of the
solvent then molality of the solute is given by the equation (1.31).
m

=

w2 / M 2
w1/1000

(1.31)

Substituting this value of molality in equation (1.34) we get:
DT f =

K f  w2 / M 2
w1 /1000

DT f =

K f × w2 × 1000
M 2 × w1

(1.35)

M2 =

K f × w2 × 1000
Tf × w1

(1.36)

Thus for determining the molar mass of the solute we should know
the quantities w1, w2, DTf, along with the molal freezing point depression
constant.
The values of Kf and Kb, which depend upon the nature of the
solvent, can be ascertained from the following relations.

Example 1.9 45 g of ethylene glycol (C H O ) is mixed with 600 g of water. Calculate

(a) the freezing point depression and (b) the freezing point of the solution.

Solution

Depression in freezing point is related to the molality, therefore, the molality
of the solution with respect to ethylene glycol =
Moles of ethylene glycol =

moles of ethylene glycol
mass of water in kilogram

45 g
= 0.73 mol
62 g mol 1

600g
Mass of water in kg = 1000g kg 1 = 0.6 kg
Hence molality of ethylene glycol =

0.73 mol
= 1.2 mol kg –1
0.60 kg

Therefore freezing point depression,

ÄTf = 1.86 K kg mol–1 × 1.2 mol kg –1 = 2.2 K
Freezing point of the aqueous solution = 273.15 K – 2.2 K = 270.95 K

Example 1.10 1.00 g of a non-electrolyte solute dissolved in 50 g of benzene lowered the
freezing point of benzene by 0.40 K. The freezing point depression constant
of benzene is 5.12 K kg mol–1. Find the molar mass of the solute.

Solution

Substituting the values of various terms involved in equation (1.36) we get,

5.12 K kg mol 1 × 1.00 g × 1000 g kg 1
= 256 g mol-1
M2 =
0.40 × 50 g
Thus, molar mass of the solute = 256 g mol-1

Chemistry

There are many phenomena which we observe in nature or at home.
For example, raw mangoes shrivel when pickled in brine (salt water);
wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water, blood cells collapse
when suspended in saline water, etc. If we look into these processes we
find one thing common in all,
that is, all these substances
are bound by membranes.
These membranes can be of
animal or vegetable origin
and these occur naturally
such as pig’s bladder or
parchment or can be
synthetic such as cellophane.
These membranes appear to
be continuous sheets or
films, yet they contain a
network of submicroscopic
holes or pores. Small solvent

molecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of
bigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind
of properties are known as semipermeable membranes (SPM).
Assume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semipermeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent
and solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through
the membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow
of the solvent is called osmosis.
The flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the
solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane
can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This
pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic
pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to
the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to
osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules
always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution.
The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration
of the solution.
The osmotic pressure of a solution is the
excess pressure that must be applied to a
solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the
passage of solvent molecules through a
semipermeable membrane into the solution. This
is illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a
colligative property as it depends on the number
of solute molecules and not on their identity.
For dilute solutions, it has been found
experimentally that osmotic pressure is
proportional to the molarity, C of the
solution at a given temperature T. Thus:
P=CRT
(1.39)
Fig. 1.10: The excess pressure equal to the
osmotic pressure must be applied on
the solution side to prevent osmosis.

Here P is the osmotic pressure and R is the
gas constant.

P = (n2 /V) R T

(1.40)

Here V is volume of a solution in litres containing n2 moles of solute.
If w2 grams of solute, of molar mass, M2 is present in the solution, then
n2 = w2 / M2 and we can write,

PV=
or M2 =

w2 R T

(1.41)

M2

w2 R T

(1.42)
∏ V
Thus, knowing the quantities w2, T, P and V we can calculate the
molar mass of the solute.
Measurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of
determining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to
determine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other

Solutions

macromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over
other methods as pressure measurement is around the room
temperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality.
As compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large
even for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for
determination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for
biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures
and polymers have poor solubility.
Two solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given
temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions
are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs
between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated
with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of
0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline
solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if
we place the cells in a solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/
volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they
would shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt
concentration is less than 0.9% (mass/volume), the solution is said
to be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed
in this solution and they would swell.

Example 1.11

200 cm3 of an aqueous solution of a protein contains 1.26 g of the
protein. The osmotic pressure of such a solution at 300 K is found to
be 2.57 × 10-3 bar. Calculate the molar mass of the protein.

Solution The various quantities known to us are as follows: P = 2.57 × 10–3 bar,
V = 200 cm3 = 0.200 litre
T = 300 K
R = 0.083 L bar mol-1 K-1
Substituting these values in equation (2.42) we get
M2 =

1.26 g × 0.083 L bar K 1 mol 1 × 300 K
= 61,022 g mol-1
2.57×103 bar × 0.200 L

The phenomena mentioned in the beginning of this section can be
explained on the basis of osmosis. A raw mango placed in concentrated
salt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted
flowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become
limp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the
water making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through
osmosis. When placed in water containing less than 0.9% (mass/
volume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis.
People taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in
tissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting

puffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into
plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly
due to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by
adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process
of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water,
shrivels and dies.
1.6.5 Reverse
Osmosis and
Water
Purification

The direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the
osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the
pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable
membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of
great practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea
water. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1.11.
When pressure more than osmotic pressure is
applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea
water through the membrane. A variety of
Π
polymer membranes are available for this
purpose.

Fig. 1.11: Reverse osmosis occurs when a
pressure larger than the osmotic
pressure is applied to the solution.

The pressure required for the reverse osmosis
is quite high. A workable porous membrane is a
film of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable
support. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water
but impermeable to impurities and ions present
in sea water. These days many countries use
desalination plants to meet their potable water
requirements.

Masses

We know that ionic compounds when dissolved in water dissociate into
cations and anions. For example, if we dissolve one mole of KCl (74.5 g)
in water, we expect one mole each of K+ and Cl– ions to be released in
the solution. If this happens, there would be two moles of particles in
the solution. If we ignore interionic attractions, one mole of KCl in
one kg of water would be expected to increase the boiling point by
2 × 0.52 K = 1.04 K. Now if we did not know about the degree of

dissociation, we could be led to conclude that the mass of 2 mol particles
is 74.5 g and the mass of one mole of KCl would be 37.25 g. This
brings into light the rule that, when there is dissociation of solute into
ions, the experimentally determined molar mass is always lower than
the true value.
2 CH3COOH ⇌ (CH3COOH)2

Molecules of ethanoic acid (acetic acid) dimerise in
benzene due to hydrogen bonding. This normally happens
in solvents of low dielectric constant. In this case the number
of particles is reduced due to dimerisation. Association of
molecules is depicted as follows:

It can be undoubtedly stated here that if all the molecules of ethanoic
acid associate in benzene, then DTb or DTf for ethanoic acid will be half
of the normal value. The molar mass calculated on the basis of this DTb
or DTf will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass
that is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called
as abnormal molar mass.
In 1880 van’t Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van’t Hoff
factor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This
factor i is defined as:
i 


i 

Normal molar mass
Abnormal molar mass

Observed colligative property
Calculated colligative property
Total number of moles of particles after association/dissociation
Number of moles of particles before association/dissociation

Here abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar
mass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming
that the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In
case of association, value of i is less than unity while for dissociation it
is greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous KCl
solution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is
nearly 0.5.

for benzene is 4.9 K kg mol–1. What is the percentage association of acid
if it forms dimer in solution?
The given quantities are: w2 = 2 g; Kf = 4.9 K kg mol–1; w1 = 25 g,
DTf = 1.62 K

Substituting these values in equation (1.36) we get:
M2 =

4.9 K kg mol –1 × 2 g × 1000 g kg –1
= 241.98 g mol–1
25 g × 1.62 K

Thus, experimental molar mass of benzoic acid in benzene is

Now consider the following equilibrium for the acid:

If x represents the degree of association of the solute then we would

Summary
A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. Solutions are
classified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is
expressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The
dissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry’s law, according to which, at a
given temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to
the partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by
the presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour
pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult’s law, according to which the relative
lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole
fraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary
liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another
form of Raoult’s law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult’s law is stated
as: p total  p1 x 1  p 2 x 2 . Solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range
of concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult’s
law, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to
very large deviations from Raoult’s law.

The properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and
are independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These
are lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing
point and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure
higher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties
have been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in
solution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which
associate show higher molar mass than their actual values.
Quantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be
expressed by van’t Hoff factor i. This factor has been defined as ratio of normal
molar mass to experimentally determined molar mass or as the ratio of observed
colligative property to the calculated colligative property.

Electrochemistry
Chemical reactions can be used to produce electrical energy,
conversely, electrical energy can be used to carry out chemical
reactions that do not proceed spontaneously.

Electrochemistry is the study of production of
electricity from energy released during spontaneous
chemical reactions and the use of electrical energy
to bring about non-spontaneous chemical
transformations. The subject is of importance both
for theoretical and practical considerations. A large
number of metals, sodium hydroxide, chlorine,
fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by
electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells
convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are
used on a large scale in various instruments and
devices. The reactions carried out electrochemically
can be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore,
study of electrochemistry is important for creating new
technologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of
sensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa
and communication between the cells are known to
have electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry, is
therefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject. In
this Unit, we will cover only some of its important
elementary aspects.

2.1 Electrochemical
Cells

We had studied the construction and functioning of Daniell cell
(Fig. 2.1). This cell converts the chemical energy liberated during the
redox reaction
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
(2.1)
to electrical energy and has an electrical
potential equal to 1.1 V when concentration
of Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions is unity (1 mol dm–3)*.
Such a device is called a galvanic or a
voltaic cell.
If an external opposite potential is applied
in the galvanic cell [Fig. 2.2(a)] and increased
slowly, we find that the reaction continues to
take place till the opposing voltage reaches
the value 1.1 V [Fig. 2.2(b)] when, the reaction
stops altogether and no current flows through
the cell. Any further increase in the external
potential again starts the reaction but in the
opposite direction [Fig. 2.2(c)]. It now functions
as an electrolytic cell, a device for using
electrical energy to carry non-spontaneous
chemical reactions. Both types of cells are

2.2 Galvanic Cells

As mentioned earlier a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that
converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into
electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous
redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for
running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan,
geyser, etc.
Daniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following
redox reaction occurs.
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)
This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition
gives the overall cell reaction:
(i) Cu2+ + 2e–
® Cu(s)
(reduction half reaction)
(2.2)
2+
–
(ii) Zn(s) ® Zn + 2e
(oxidation half reaction)
(2.3)
These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell.
The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the
oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions
of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper
electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode,
the oxidation half-cell.
We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern
of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each halfcell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two
half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a
switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected
internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both
the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we
do not require a salt bridge.
At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal
ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make
it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode
have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the
electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At
equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the
tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively
or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference
develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called
electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved
in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard
electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard
reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a
galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode
and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other
half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a
positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a
potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the
switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode
to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of
electron flow.

The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic
cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell
potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction
potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive
force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It
is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and
the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic
cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal
and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between
the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention
the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the halfcell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the
left hand side i.e.,
Ecell = Eright – Eleft
This is illustrated by the following example:
Cell reaction:
Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) ¾® Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s)

(2.4)

Half-cell reactions:
Cathode (reduction): 2Ag+(aq) + 2e– ® 2Ag(s)
Anode (oxidation):
Cu(s) ® Cu2+(aq) + 2e–

(2.5)
(2.6)

It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction
(2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper
electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:
Cu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s)
and we have Ecell = Eright – Eleft = EAg úAg – ECu úCu
+

2.2.1
Measurement
of Electrode
Potential

(2.7)

The potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can
measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that
gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one
electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect
to this. According to convention, a half-cell
called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3)
represented by Pt(s)ú H2(g)ú H+(aq), is assigned
a zero potential at all temperatures
corresponding to the reaction
1
H (g)
H+ (aq) + e– ®
2 2
The standard hydrogen electrode consists
of a platinum electrode coated with platinum
black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic
solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled
through it. The concentration of both the
reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is
maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies
that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar
and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the
solution is one molar.

At 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode ççsecond
half-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode
(reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction
potential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and
the reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity,
then the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential, E oR of
the given half-cell.

–
Zn (aq, 1 M) + 2e ® Zn(s)
The positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first
2+
+
case indicates that Cu ions get reduced more easily than H ions. The
reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu
(or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion)
under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not
dissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by
hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential
in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or
zinc can reduce hydrogen ions).
In view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in
Fig. 2.1 can be written as:
2+
–
Left electrode: Zn(s) ® Zn (aq, 1 M) + 2 e
2+
–
Right electrode: Cu (aq, 1 M) + 2 e ® Cu(s)
The overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions
and we obtain the equation:
2+
2+
Zn(s) + Cu (aq) ® Zn (aq) + Cu(s)
o
emf of the cell = E cell = E oR – E oL
= 0.34V – (– 0.76)V = 1.10 V
Sometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes.
They do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for
oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons.
For example, Pt is used in the following half-cells:
Hydrogen electrode: Pt(s)|H2(g)| H+(aq)
With half-cell reaction: H+ (aq)+ e– ® ½ H2(g)
Bromine electrode: Pt(s)|Br2(aq)| Br–(aq)

With half-cell reaction: ½ Br2(aq) + e– ® Br–(aq)
The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can
extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard
electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are
given in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode
is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to
hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative
then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species.
It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the
highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F2) has the maximum
tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F–) and therefore fluorine
gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest
reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating
that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is
the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be
seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard
electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising
power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of
the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical
cells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility
product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties
and for potentiometric titrations.

If the circuit in Daniell cell (Fig. 2.1) is closed then we note that the reaction
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
(2.1)
takes place and as time passes, the concentration of Zn 2+ keeps
on increasing while the concentration of Cu2+ keeps on decreasing.
At the same time voltage of the cell as read on the voltmeter keeps
on decreasing. After some time, we shall note that there is no change
in the concentration of Cu 2+ and Zn2+ ions and at the same time,
voltmeter gives zero reading. This indicates that equilibrium has been
attained. In this situation the Nernst equation may be written as:

2.3.2 Electrochemical
Cell and
Gibbs
Energy of
the Reaction

Electrical work done in one second is equal to electrical potential
multiplied by total charge passed. If we want to obtain maximum work
from a galvanic cell then charge has to be passed reversibly. The
reversible work done by a galvanic cell is equal to decrease in its Gibbs
energy and therefore, if the emf of the cell is E and nF is the amount
of charge passed and DrG is the Gibbs energy of the reaction, then
DrG = – nFE(cell)
(2.15)
It may be remembered that E(cell) is an intensive parameter but DrG
is an extensive thermodynamic property and the value depends on n.
Thus, if we write the reaction
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ¾® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
(2.1)
DrG = – 2FE(cell)
but when we write the reaction
2 Zn (s) + 2 Cu2+(aq) ¾®2 Zn2+(aq) + 2Cu(s)
DrG = – 4FE(cell)
If the concentration of all the reacting species is unity, then
E(cell) = E(ocell ) and we have
o

DrG o = – nF E(cell)

(2.16)
o
(cell )

Thus, from the measurement of E
we can obtain an important
o
thermodynamic quantity, DrG , standard Gibbs energy of the reaction.
From the latter we can calculate equilibrium constant by the equation:
DrGo = –RT ln K.

the standard Gibbs energy for the reaction:

2.4 Conductance
of Electrolytic
Solutions

It is necessary to define a few terms before we consider the subject of
conductance of electricity through electrolytic solutions. The electrical
resistance is represented by the symbol ‘R’ and it is measured in ohm (W)
which in terms of SI base units is equal to (kg m2)/(S 3 A2). It can be
measured with the help of a Wheatstone bridge with which you are
familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object
is directly proportional to its length, l, and inversely proportional to its
area of cross section, A. That is,

l
l
or R = r
(2.17)
A
A
The constant of proportionality, r (Greek, rho), is called resistivity
(specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre (W m) and quite often
its submultiple, ohm centimetre (W cm) is also used. IUPAC recommends
the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the
rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity
for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area
of cross section is one m2. It can be seen that:
R µ

1 W m = 100 W cm or 1 W cm = 0.01 W m
The inverse of resistance, R, is called conductance, G, and we have
the relation:
G =

1
A

=κ
R
ρl

(2.18)

The SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol
‘S’ and is equal to ohm–1 (also known as mho) or W–1. The inverse of
resistivity, called conductivity (specific conductance) is represented by
the symbol, k (Greek, kappa). IUPAC has recommended the use of term
conductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term
conductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are
S m–1 but quite often, k is expressed in S cm–1. Conductivity of a
material in S m–1 is its conductance when it is 1 m long and its area
of cross section is 1 m2. It may be noted that 1 S cm–1 = 100 S m–1.

It can be seen from Table 2.2 that the magnitude of conductivity
varies a great deal and depends on the nature of the material. It also
depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements
are made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and
semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals
and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors.
Certain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic
polymers* are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass,
ceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators.
Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having
conductivity between conductors and insulators are called
semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials
called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite
conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures
(0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a
number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show
superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K.
Electrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic
conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic
conductance depends on
(i) the nature and structure of the metal
(ii) the number of valence electrons per atom
(iii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature).
*

Electronically conducting polymers – In 1977 MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa discovered that acetylene gas can be
polymerised to produce a polymer, polyacetylene when exposed to vapours of iodine acquires metallic lustre and
conductivity. Since then several organic conducting polymers have been made such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and
polythiophene. These organic polymers which have properties like metals, being composed wholly of elements like
carbon, hydrogen and occasionally nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, are much lighter than normal metals and can be used
for making light-weight batteries. Besides, they have the mechanical properties of polymers such as flexibility so that
one can make electronic devices such as transistors that can bend like a sheet of plastic. For the discovery of conducting
polymers, MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2000.

As the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end,
the composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The
mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex.
We already know that even very pure water has small amounts of
hydrogen and hydroxyl ions (~10–7M) which lend it very low conductivity
(3.5 × 10–5 S m–1). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish
their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The
conductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called
electrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic)
solutions depends on:
(i) the nature of the electrolyte added
(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation
(iii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity
(iv) concentration of the electrolyte
(v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature).
Passage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged
period can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical
reactions (Section 2.4.1).
2.4.1 Measurement
of the
Conductivity
of Ionic
Solutions

We know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be
performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance
of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current
(DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot
be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor.
The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source
of power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed
vessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two
simple ones are shown in Fig. 2.4.

Platinized Pt electrode

Basically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum
black (finely divided metallic Pt is deposited on the electrodes
electrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to ‘A’ and are
separated by distance ‘l’. Therefore, solution confined between these
electrodes is a column of length l and area of cross section A. The
resistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation:

The quantity l/A is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, G*.
It depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of
cross-section and has the dimension of length–1 and can be calculated
if we know l and A. Measurement of l and A is not only inconvenient
but also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring
the resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is
already known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose
conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 2.3)
and at different temperatures. The cell constant, G*, is then given by
the equation:

Once the cell constant is determined, we can
use it for measuring the resistance or conductivity
of any solution. The set up for the measurement
of the resistance is shown in Fig. 2.5.
It consists of two resistances R3 and R4, a
variable resistance R1 and the conductivity cell
having the unknown resistance R 2 . The
Wheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator O (a
source of a.c. power in the audio frequency range
550 to 5000 cycles per second). P is a suitable
detector (a headphone or other electronic device)
and the bridge is balanced when no current passes
through the detector. Under these conditions:

These days, inexpensive conductivity meters are

ions in which they dissociate, the concentration of ions or ease with
which the ions move under a potential gradient. It, therefore, becomes
necessary to define a physically more meaningful quantity called molar
conductivity denoted by the symbol Lm (Greek, lambda). It is related
to the conductivity of the solution by the equation:
Molar conductivity = Lm =



(2.21)

c

In the above equation, if k is expressed in S m–1 and the concentration,
c in mol m–3 then the units of Lm are in S m2 mol–1. It may be noted that:
1 mol m–3 = 1000(L/m3) × molarity (mol/L), and hence

Lm(S cm mol ) =
2

–1

 (S cm 1 )
1000 L m 3 × molarity (mol L1 )

If we use S cm–1 as the units for k and mol cm–3, the units of
concentration, then the units for Lm are S cm2 mol–1. It can be calculated
by using the equation:

Lm (S cm mol ) =
2

–1

 (S cm 1 ) × 1000 (cm 3 / L)

molarity (mol / L)
Both type of units are used in literature and are related to each
other by the equations:
1 S m2mol–1 = 104 S cm2mol–1 or
1 S cm2mol–1 = 10–4 S m2mol–1.

Resistance of a conductivity cell filled with 0.1 mol L–1 KCl solution is
100 W . If the resistance of the same cell when filled with 0.02 mol L–1
KCl solution is 520 W , calculate the conductivity and molar conductivity
of 0.02 mol L–1 KCl solution. The conductivity of 0.1 mol L–1 KCl
solution is 1.29 S/m.
The cell constant is given by the equation:
Cell constant = G* = conductivity × resistance

concentration of the electrolyte. Conductivity always decreases with
decrease in concentration both, for weak and strong electrolytes.
This can be explained by the fact that the number of ions per unit
volume that carry the current in a solution decreases on dilution.
The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the
conductance of one unit volume of solution kept between two

platinum electrodes with unit area of cross section and at a distance
of unit length. This is clear from the equation:
G =  A =  (both A and l are unity in their appropriate units in
l
m or cm)
Molar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the
conductance of the volume V of solution containing one mole of
electrolyte kept between two electrodes with area of cross section A and
distance of unit length. Therefore,
κA
Λm =
=κ
l
Since l = 1 and A = V ( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte)
Lm = k V
(2.22)

Fig. 2.6: Molar conductivity versus c½ for acetic
acid (weak electrolyte) and potassium
chloride (strong electrolyte) in aqueous
solutions.

Molar conductivity increases with
decrease in concentration. This is
because the total volume, V, of solution
containing one mole of electrolyte also
increases. It has been found that decrease
in k on dilution of a solution is more
than compensated by increase in its
volume. Physically, it means that at a
given concentration, Lm can be defined
as the conductance of the electrolytic
solution kept between the electrodes of a
conductivity cell at unit distance but
having area of cross section large enough
to accommodate sufficient volume of
solution that contains one mole of the
electrolyte. When concentration
approaches zero, the molar conductivity
is known as limiting molar
conductivity and is represented by the
symbol L°m . The variation in Lm with
concentration is different (Fig. 2.6) for
strong and weak electrolytes.

Strong Electrolytes

For strong electrolytes, Lm increases slowly with dilution and can be
represented by the equation:

Lm = L°m – A c ½

(2.23)

It can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 2.6) L m against
c1/2, we obtain a straight line with intercept equal to L°m and slope
equal to ‘–A’. The value of the constant ‘A’ for a given solvent and
temperature depends on the type of electrolyte i.e., the charges on the
cation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in the
solution. Thus, NaCl, CaCl2, MgSO4 are known as 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2
electrolytes respectively. All electrolytes of a particular type have the
same value for ‘A’.

Kohlrausch examined L°m values for a number of strong electrolytes
and observed certain regularities. He noted that the difference in L°m of
the electrolytes NaX and KX for any X is nearly constant. For example
at 298 K:
L°m (KCl) – L°m (NaCl) = L°m (KBr) – L°m (NaBr)
= L°m (KI) – L°m (NaI) ≃ 23.4 S cm2 mol–1
and similarly it was found that
L°m (NaBr)– L°m (NaCl) = L°m (KBr) – L°m (KCl) ≃ 1.8 S cm2 mol–1
On the basis of the above observations he enunciated Kohlrausch
law of independent migration of ions. The law states that limiting
molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the
individual contributions of the anion and cation of the electrolyte. Thus,
if l°Na+ and l°Cl– are limiting molar conductivity of the sodium and chloride
ions respectively, then the limiting molar conductivity for sodium chloride
is given by the equation:
(2.24)
L°m (NaCl) = l°Na+ + l°Cl–
In general, if an electrolyte on dissociation gives n+ cations and n–
anions then its limiting molar conductivity is given by:

L°m = n+ l°+ + n– l°–

(2.25)

Here, l°+ and l°– are the limiting molar conductivities of the cation
and anion respectively. The values of l° for some cations and anions at
298 K are given in Table 2.4.

Weak Electrolytes

Weak electrolytes like acetic acid have lower degree of dissociation at
higher concentrations and hence for such electrolytes, the change in Lm
with dilution is due to increase in the degree of dissociation and
consequently the number of ions in total volume of solution that contains
1 mol of electrolyte. In such cases Lm increases steeply (Fig. 2.6) on
dilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, L°m cannot be
obtained by extrapolation of Lm to zero concentration. At infinite dilution
(i.e., concentration c ® zero) electrolyte dissociates completely (a =1),
but at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low
that it cannot be measured accurately. Therefore, L°m for weak electrolytes
is obtained by using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions
(Example 2.8). At any concentration c, if a is the degree of dissociation

2.5 Electrolytic
Cells and
Electrolysis

In an electrolytic cell external source of voltage is used to bring about
a chemical reaction. The electrochemical processes are of great importance
in the laboratory and the chemical industry. One of the simplest electrolytic
cell consists of two copper strips dipping in an aqueous solution of
copper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then
Cu 2+ ions discharge at the cathode (negatively charged) and the following
reaction takes place:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e– ® Cu (s)
(2.28)
Copper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is
converted into Cu2+ ions by the reaction:
Cu(s) ® Cu2+(s) + 2e–
(2.29)
Thus copper is dissolved (oxidised) at anode and deposited
(reduced) at cathode. This is the basis for an industrial process in
which impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The
impure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current
and pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg,
Al, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of
their respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents
are available for this purpose.
Sodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of
their fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of
aluminium oxide in presence of cryolite.
Quantitative Aspects of Electrolysis

Michael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative
aspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday’s laws also flow from what has
been discussed earlier.
Faraday’s Laws of Electrolysis

After his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts
of electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833-34 in the
form of the following well known Faraday’s two laws of electrolysis:
(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any
electrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the
quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte (solution or
melt).
(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the
same quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution
are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass
of Metal ÷ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation).
51

Electrochemistry

Rationalised 2023-24

There were no constant current sources available during Faraday’s
times. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic
cell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount
of metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However,
coulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current (I)
sources available and the quantity of electricity Q, passed is given by
Q = It
Q is in coloumbs when I is in ampere and t is in second.
The amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or
reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For
example, in the reaction:
Ag +(aq) + e– ® Ag(s)
(2.30)
One mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole
of silver ions.
We know that charge on one electron is equal to 1.6021 × 10–19C.
Therefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to:
NA × 1.6021 × 10–19 C = 6.02 × 1023 mol–1 × 1.6021 × 10–19
C = 96487 C mol–1
This quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by
the symbol F.
For approximate calculations we use 1F ≃ 96500 C mol–1.
For the electrode reactions:
Mg2+(l) + 2e– ¾® Mg(s)
(2.31)
Al3+(l) + 3e– ¾® Al(s)
(2.32)
2+
3+
It is obvious that one mole of Mg and Al require 2 mol of electrons
(2F) and 3 mol of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through
the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current
in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals,
current as high as 50,000 amperes are used that amounts to about
0.518 F per second.

Example 2.10 A solution of CuSO4 is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of

1.5 amperes. What is the mass of copper deposited at the cathode?

Solution t = 600 s charge = current × time = 1.5 A × 600 s = 900 C
According to the reaction:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e– = Cu(s)
We require 2F or 2 × 96487 C to deposit 1 mol or 63 g of Cu.
For 900 C, the mass of Cu deposited
= (63 g mol–1 × 900 C)/(2 × 96487 C mol–1) = 0.2938 g.
2.5.1 Products of
Electrolysis

Chemistry

Products of electrolysis depend on the nature of material being
electrolysed and the type of electrodes being used. If the electrode is
inert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical
reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other
hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction.
Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert

52

Rationalised 2023-24

electrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising
and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard
electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes
although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do
not seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential) has to
be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur.
For example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are
sodium metal and Cl2 gas. Here we have only one cation (Na+) which is
reduced at the cathode (Na+ + e– ® Na) and one anion (Cl–) which is
oxidised at the anode (Cl– ® ½Cl2 + e–). During the electrolysis of aqueous
sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, Cl2 and H2. In this
case besides Na+ and Cl– ions we also have H+ and OH– ions along with
the solvent molecules, H2O.
At the cathode there is competition between the following reduction
reactions:
Na+ (aq) + e– ® Na (s)

E(ocell ) = – 2.71 V

H+ (aq) + e– ® ½ H2 (g)

E(ocell ) = 0.00 V

The reaction with higher value of E o is preferred and therefore, the
reaction at the cathode during electrolysis is:
H+ (aq) + e– ® ½ H2 (g)
(2.33)
but H+ (aq) is produced by the dissociation of H2O, i.e.,
H2O (l ) ® H+ (aq) + OH– (aq)

(2.34)

Therefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum
of (2.33) and (2.34) and we have
H2O (l ) + e– ® ½H2(g) + OH–
(2.35)
At the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible:
Cl– (aq) ® ½ Cl2 (g) + e–

E(ocell ) = 1.36 V

(2.36)

2H2O (l ) ® O2 (g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e–

E(ocell ) = 1.23 V

(2.37)

The reaction at anode with lower value of E o is preferred and
therefore, water should get oxidised in preference to Cl– (aq). However,
on account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction (2.36) is preferred. Thus,
the net reactions may be summarised as:
H O

NaCl (aq) 
Cathode:

Anode:

Net reaction:
NaCl(aq) + H2O(l ) ® Na+(aq) + OH–(aq) + ½H2(g) + ½Cl2(g)

The standard electrode potentials are replaced by electrode potentials
given by Nernst equation (Eq. 2.8) to take into account the concentration
effects. During the electrolysis of sulphuric acid, the following processes
are possible at the anode:
2H2O(l ) ® O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e–

2.6 Batteries

Any battery (actually it may have one or more than one cell connected
in series) or cell that we use as a source of electrical energy is basically
a galvanic cell where the chemical energy of the redox reaction is
converted into electrical energy. However, for a battery to be of practical
use it should be reasonably light, compact and its voltage should not
vary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries.

In the primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use
over a period of time battery becomes dead and cannot be reused
again. The most familiar example of this type is the dry
cell (known as Leclanche cell after its discoverer) which is
used commonly in our transistors and clocks. The cell
consists of a zinc container that also acts as anode and
the cathode is a carbon (graphite) rod surrounded by
powdered manganese dioxide and carbon (Fig.2.8). The
space between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of
ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and zinc chloride (ZnCl2). The
electrode reactions are complex, but they can be written
approximately as follows :
Anode:
Zn(s) ¾® Zn2+ + 2e–
Cathode: MnO2+ NH4++ e–¾® MnO(OH) + NH3
In the reaction at cathode, manganese is reduced
from the + 4 oxidation state to the +3 state. Ammonia
produced in the reaction forms a complex with Zn2+ to give
[Zn (NH3)4]2+. The cell has a potential of nearly 1.5 V.
Mercury cell, (Fig. 2.9) suitable for low current devices
like hearing aids, watches, etc. consists of zinc – mercury
amalgam as anode and a paste of HgO and carbon as the

2.6.2 Secondary
Batteries

A secondary cell after use can be recharged by passing current
through it in the opposite direction so that it can be used again. A
good secondary cell can undergo a large number of discharging
and charging cycles. The most important secondary cell is the lead
storage battery (Fig. 2.10) commonly used in automobiles and
invertors. It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with
lead dioxide (PbO 2 ) as cathode. A 38% solution of sulphuric acid
is used as an electrolyte.
The cell reactions when the battery is in use are given below:
Anode:

Pb(s) + SO42–(aq) ® PbSO4(s) + 2e–

Cathode: PbO2(s) + SO42–(aq) + 4H+(aq) + 2e– ® PbSO4 (s) + 2H2O (l )
i.e., overall cell reaction consisting of cathode and anode reactions is:
Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 2H2SO4(aq) ® 2PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(l)
On charging the battery the reaction is reversed and PbSO4(s) on
anode and cathode is converted into Pb and PbO2, respectively.

2.7 Fuel Cells

Production of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method
and is a major source of pollution. In such plants, the chemical energy
(heat of combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, gas or oil) is first used for
converting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run
a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly
converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is
now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously
to the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the
electrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert
the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol,
etc. directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells.
One of the most successful fuel cells
uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen
to form water (Fig. 2.12). The cell was
used for providing electrical power in the
Apollo space programme. The water
vapours produced during the reaction
were condensed and added to the
drinking water supply for the astronauts.
In the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are
bubbled through porous carbon
electrodes into concentrated aqueous
sodium hydroxide solution. Catalysts like
finely divided platinum or palladium
metal are incorporated into the electrodes
for increasing the rate of electrode

to thermal plants whose efficiency is about 40%. There has been
tremendous progress in the development of new electrode materials,
better catalysts and electrolytes for increasing the efficiency of fuel cells.
These have been used in automobiles on an experimental basis. Fuel
cells are pollution free and in view of their future importance, a variety
of fuel cells have been fabricated and tried.

2.8 Corrosion

Corrosion slowly coats the surfaces of metallic objects with oxides or
other salts of the metal. The rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver,
development of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the
examples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to
buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of
metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees
every year on account of corrosion.
In corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons
to oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron
(commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of
water and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite
complex but it may be considered

The ferrous ions are further oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to
ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide
(Fe2O3. x H2O) and with further production of hydrogen ions.
Prevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves
money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse
or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest
methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic
object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering
the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another
simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that
are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to
provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which
corrodes itself but saves the object.

The Hydrogen Economy
At present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels
such as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their
standard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per
capita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it
is assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted.
We are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil
fuels is resulting in the ‘Greenhouse Effect’. This is leading to a rise in the
temperature of the Earth’s surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels
to rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations
such as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope,
we need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal
alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must
come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used
as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the
Hydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water
and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And
both these technologies are based on electrochemical principles.

Summary
An electrochemical cell consists of two metallic electrodes dipping in electrolytic
solution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic
conductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell,
the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical
work, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a nonspontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode
dipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode
potential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell
can be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and
o
anode ( E(cell ) = E ocathode – E oanode). The standard potential of the cells are
o

related to standard Gibbs energy (DrGo = –nF E(cell ) ) and equilibrium constant
(DrGo = – RT ln K) of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence
of the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation.
The conductivity, k, of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration
of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, Lm, is
defined by = k/c where c is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar
conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with
decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep
for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar
conductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the

molar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of
independent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity
through the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the
electrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful
forms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical
phenomenon. Electrochemical principles are relevant to the Hydrogen Economy.

Electrochemistry
Chemical reactions can be used to produce electrical energy,
conversely, electrical energy can be used to carry out chemical
reactions that do not proceed spontaneously.

Electrochemistry is the study of production of
electricity from energy released during spontaneous
chemical reactions and the use of electrical energy
to bring about non-spontaneous chemical
transformations. The subject is of importance both
for theoretical and practical considerations. A large
number of metals, sodium hydroxide, chlorine,
fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by
electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells
convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are
used on a large scale in various instruments and
devices. The reactions carried out electrochemically
can be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore,
study of electrochemistry is important for creating new
technologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of
sensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa
and communication between the cells are known to
have electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry, is
therefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject. In
this Unit, we will cover only some of its important
elementary aspects.

2.1 Electrochemical
Cells

We had studied the construction and functioning of Daniell cell
(Fig. 2.1). This cell converts the chemical energy liberated during the
redox reaction
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
(2.1)
to electrical energy and has an electrical
potential equal to 1.1 V when concentration
of Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions is unity (1 mol dm–3)*.
Such a device is called a galvanic or a
voltaic cell.
If an external opposite potential is applied
in the galvanic cell [Fig. 2.2(a)] and increased
slowly, we find that the reaction continues to
take place till the opposing voltage reaches
the value 1.1 V [Fig. 2.2(b)] when, the reaction
stops altogether and no current flows through
the cell. Any further increase in the external
potential again starts the reaction but in the
opposite direction [Fig. 2.2(c)]. It now functions
as an electrolytic cell, a device for using
electrical energy to carry non-spontaneous
chemical reactions. Both types of cells are

2.2 Galvanic Cells

As mentioned earlier a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that
converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into
electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous
redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for
running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan,
geyser, etc.
Daniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following
redox reaction occurs.
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)
This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition
gives the overall cell reaction:
(i) Cu2+ + 2e–
® Cu(s)
(reduction half reaction)
(2.2)
2+
–
(ii) Zn(s) ® Zn + 2e
(oxidation half reaction)
(2.3)
These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell.
The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the
oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions
of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper
electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode,
the oxidation half-cell.
We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern
of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each halfcell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two
half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a
switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected
internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both
the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we
do not require a salt bridge.
At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal
ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make
it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode
have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the
electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At
equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the
tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively
or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference
develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called
electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved
in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard
electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard
reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a
galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode
and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other
half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a
positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a
potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the
switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode
to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of
electron flow.

The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic
cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell
potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction
potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive
force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It
is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and
the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic
cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal
and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between
the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention
the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the halfcell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the
left hand side i.e.,
Ecell = Eright – Eleft
This is illustrated by the following example:
Cell reaction:
Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) ¾® Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s)

(2.4)

Half-cell reactions:
Cathode (reduction): 2Ag+(aq) + 2e– ® 2Ag(s)
Anode (oxidation):
Cu(s) ® Cu2+(aq) + 2e–

(2.5)
(2.6)

It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction
(2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper
electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:
Cu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s)
and we have Ecell = Eright – Eleft = EAg úAg – ECu úCu
+

2.2.1
Measurement
of Electrode
Potential

(2.7)

The potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can
measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that
gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one
electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect
to this. According to convention, a half-cell
called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3)
represented by Pt(s)ú H2(g)ú H+(aq), is assigned
a zero potential at all temperatures
corresponding to the reaction
1
H (g)
H+ (aq) + e– ®
2 2
The standard hydrogen electrode consists
of a platinum electrode coated with platinum
black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic
solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled
through it. The concentration of both the
reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is
maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies
that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar
and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the
solution is one molar.

At 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode ççsecond
half-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode
(reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction
potential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and
the reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity,
then the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential, E oR of
the given half-cell.

–
Zn (aq, 1 M) + 2e ® Zn(s)
The positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first
2+
+
case indicates that Cu ions get reduced more easily than H ions. The
reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu
(or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion)
under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not
dissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by
hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential
in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or
zinc can reduce hydrogen ions).
In view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in
Fig. 2.1 can be written as:
2+
–
Left electrode: Zn(s) ® Zn (aq, 1 M) + 2 e
2+
–
Right electrode: Cu (aq, 1 M) + 2 e ® Cu(s)
The overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions
and we obtain the equation:

Zn(s) + Cu (aq) ® Zn (aq) + Cu(s)
o
emf of the cell = E cell = E oR – E oL
= 0.34V – (– 0.76)V = 1.10 V
Sometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes.
They do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for
oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons.
For example, Pt is used in the following half-cells:
Hydrogen electrode: Pt(s)|H2(g)| H+(aq)
With half-cell reaction: H+ (aq)+ e– ® ½ H2(g)
Bromine electrode: Pt(s)|Br2(aq)| Br–(aq)

With half-cell reaction: ½ Br2(aq) + e– ® Br–(aq)
The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can
extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard
electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are
given in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode
is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to
hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative
then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species.
It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the
highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F2) has the maximum
tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F–) and therefore fluorine
gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest
reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating
that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is
the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be
seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard
electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising
power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of
the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical
cells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility
product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties
and for potentiometric titrations.

If the circuit in Daniell cell (Fig. 2.1) is closed then we note that the reaction
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
(2.1)
takes place and as time passes, the concentration of Zn 2+ keeps
on increasing while the concentration of Cu2+ keeps on decreasing.
At the same time voltage of the cell as read on the voltmeter keeps
on decreasing. After some time, we shall note that there is no change
in the concentration of Cu 2+ and Zn2+ ions and at the same time,
voltmeter gives zero reading. This indicates that equilibrium has been

2.3.2 Electrochemical
Cell and
Gibbs
Energy of
the Reaction

Electrical work done in one second is equal to electrical potential
multiplied by total charge passed. If we want to obtain maximum work
from a galvanic cell then charge has to be passed reversibly. The
reversible work done by a galvanic cell is equal to decrease in its Gibbs
energy and therefore, if the emf of the cell is E and nF is the amount
of charge passed and DrG is the Gibbs energy of the reaction, then
DrG = – nFE(cell)
(2.15)
It may be remembered that E(cell) is an intensive parameter but DrG
is an extensive thermodynamic property and the value depends on n.
Thus, if we write the reaction
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ¾® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s)
(2.1)
DrG = – 2FE(cell)
but when we write the reaction
2 Zn (s) + 2 Cu2+(aq) ¾®2 Zn2+(aq) + 2Cu(s)
DrG = – 4FE(cell)
If the concentration of all the reacting species is unity, then
E(cell) = E(ocell ) and we have
o

DrG o = – nF E(cell)

(2.16)

Thus, from the measurement of E
we can obtain an important

thermodynamic quantity, DrG , standard Gibbs energy of the reaction.
From the latter we can calculate equilibrium constant by the equation:
DrGo = –RT ln K.

2.4 Conductance
of Electrolytic
Solutions

It is necessary to define a few terms before we consider the subject of
conductance of electricity through electrolytic solutions. The electrical
resistance is represented by the symbol ‘R’ and it is measured in ohm (W)
which in terms of SI base units is equal to (kg m2)/(S 3 A2). It can be
measured with the help of a Wheatstone bridge with which you are
familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object
is directly proportional to its length, l, and inversely proportional to its
area of cross section, A. That is,

l
l
or R = r
(2.17)
A
A
The constant of proportionality, r (Greek, rho), is called resistivity
(specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre (W m) and quite often
its submultiple, ohm centimetre (W cm) is also used. IUPAC recommends
the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the
rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity
for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area
of cross section is one m2. It can be seen that:
R µ

1 W m = 100 W cm or 1 W cm = 0.01 W m
The inverse of resistance, R, is called conductance, G, and we have
the relation:
G =

1
A
A
=
=κ
R
ρl
l

(2.18)

The SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol
‘S’ and is equal to ohm–1 (also known as mho) or W–1. The inverse of
resistivity, called conductivity (specific conductance) is represented by
the symbol, k (Greek, kappa). IUPAC has recommended the use of term
conductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term
conductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are
S m–1 but quite often, k is expressed in S cm–1. Conductivity of a
material in S m–1 is its conductance when it is 1 m long and its area
of cross section is 1 m2. It may be noted that 1 S cm–1 = 100 S m–1.

It can be seen from Table 2.2 that the magnitude of conductivity
varies a great deal and depends on the nature of the material. It also
depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements
are made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and
semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals
and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors.
Certain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic
polymers* are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass,
ceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators.
Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having
conductivity between conductors and insulators are called
semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials
called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite
conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures
(0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a
number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show
superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K.
Electrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic
conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic
conductance depends on
(i) the nature and structure of the metal
(ii) the number of valence electrons per atom
(iii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature).
*

Electronically conducting polymers – In 1977 MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa discovered that acetylene gas can be
polymerised to produce a polymer, polyacetylene when exposed to vapours of iodine acquires metallic lustre and
conductivity. Since then several organic conducting polymers have been made such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and
polythiophene. These organic polymers which have properties like metals, being composed wholly of elements like
carbon, hydrogen and occasionally nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, are much lighter than normal metals and can be used
for making light-weight batteries. Besides, they have the mechanical properties of polymers such as flexibility so that
one can make electronic devices such as transistors that can bend like a sheet of plastic. For the discovery of conducting
polymers, MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2000.

As the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end,
the composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The
mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex.
We already know that even very pure water has small amounts of
hydrogen and hydroxyl ions (~10–7M) which lend it very low conductivity
(3.5 × 10–5 S m–1). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish
their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The
conductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called
electrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic)
solutions depends on:
(i) the nature of the electrolyte added
(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation
(iii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity
(iv) concentration of the electrolyte
(v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature).
Passage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged
period can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical
reactions (Section 2.4.1).
2.4.1 Measurement
of the
Conductivity
of Ionic
Solutions

We know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be
performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance
of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current
(DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot
be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor.
The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source
of power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed
vessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two
simple ones are shown in Fig. 2.4.

Basically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum
black (finely divided metallic Pt is deposited on the electrodes
electrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to ‘A’ and are
separated by distance ‘l’. Therefore, solution confined between these
electrodes is a column of length l and area of cross section A. The
resistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation:

The quantity l/A is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, G*.
It depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of
cross-section and has the dimension of length–1 and can be calculated
if we know l and A. Measurement of l and A is not only inconvenient
but also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring
the resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is
already known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose
conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 2.3)
and at different temperatures. The cell constant, G*, is then given by
the equation:

Once the cell constant is determined, we can
use it for measuring the resistance or conductivity
of any solution. The set up for the measurement
of the resistance is shown in Fig. 2.5.
It consists of two resistances R3 and R4, a
variable resistance R1 and the conductivity cell
having the unknown resistance R 2 . The
Wheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator O (a
source of a.c. power in the audio frequency range
550 to 5000 cycles per second). P is a suitable
detector (a headphone or other electronic device)
and the bridge is balanced when no current passes
through the detector. Under these conditions:

ions in which they dissociate, the concentration of ions or ease with
which the ions move under a potential gradient. It, therefore, becomes
necessary to define a physically more meaningful quantity called molar
conductivity denoted by the symbol Lm (Greek, lambda). It is related
to the conductivity of the solution by the equation:
Molar conductivity = Lm =



(2.21)

c

In the above equation, if k is expressed in S m–1 and the concentration,
c in mol m–3 then the units of Lm are in S m2 mol–1. It may be noted that:

Lm(S cm mol ) =

–1

 (S cm 1 )
1000 L m 3 × molarity (mol L1 )

If we use S cm–1 as the units for k and mol cm–3, the units of
concentration, then the units for Lm are S cm2 mol–1. It can be calculated
by using the equation:

Lm (S cm mol ) =
2

–1

 (S cm 1 ) × 1000 (cm 3 / L)

molarity (mol / L)
Both type of units are used in literature and are related to each
other by the equations:
1 S m2mol–1 = 104 S cm2mol–1 or
1 S cm2mol–1 = 10–4 S m2mol–1.

Resistance of a conductivity cell filled with 0.1 mol L–1 KCl solution is
100 W . If the resistance of the same cell when filled with 0.02 mol L–1
KCl solution is 520 W , calculate the conductivity and molar conductivity
of 0.02 mol L–1 KCl solution. The conductivity of 0.1 mol L–1 KCl
solution is 1.29 S/m.
The cell constant is given by the equation:
Cell constant = G* = conductivity × resistance

Both conductivity and molar conductivity change with the
concentration of the electrolyte. Conductivity always decreases with
decrease in concentration both, for weak and strong electrolytes.
This can be explained by the fact that the number of ions per unit
volume that carry the current in a solution decreases on dilution.
The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the
conductance of one unit volume of solution kept between two

platinum electrodes with unit area of cross section and at a distance
of unit length. This is clear from the equation:
G =  A =  (both A and l are unity in their appropriate units in
l
m or cm)
Molar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the
conductance of the volume V of solution containing one mole of
electrolyte kept between two electrodes with area of cross section A and
distance of unit length. Therefore,
κA
Λm =
=κ
l
Since l = 1 and A = V ( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte)
Lm = k V
(2.22)

Fig. 2.6: Molar conductivity versus c½ for acetic
acid (weak electrolyte) and potassium
chloride (strong electrolyte) in aqueous
solutions.

Molar conductivity increases with
decrease in concentration. This is
because the total volume, V, of solution
containing one mole of electrolyte also
increases. It has been found that decrease
in k on dilution of a solution is more
than compensated by increase in its
volume. Physically, it means that at a
given concentration, Lm can be defined
as the conductance of the electrolytic
solution kept between the electrodes of a
conductivity cell at unit distance but
having area of cross section large enough
to accommodate sufficient volume of
solution that contains one mole of the
electrolyte. When concentration
approaches zero, the molar conductivity
is known as limiting molar
conductivity and is represented by the
symbol L°m . The variation in Lm with
concentration is different (Fig. 2.6) for
strong and weak electrolytes.

Strong Electrolytes

For strong electrolytes, Lm increases slowly with dilution and can be
represented by the equation:

Lm = L°m – A c ½

(2.23)

It can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 2.6) L m against
c1/2, we obtain a straight line with intercept equal to L°m and slope
equal to ‘–A’. The value of the constant ‘A’ for a given solvent and
temperature depends on the type of electrolyte i.e., the charges on the
cation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in the
solution. Thus, NaCl, CaCl2, MgSO4 are known as 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2
electrolytes respectively. All electrolytes of a particular type have the
same value for ‘A’.

Kohlrausch examined L°m values for a number of strong electrolytes
and observed certain regularities. He noted that the difference in L°m of
the electrolytes NaX and KX for any X is nearly constant. For example
at 298 K:
L°m (KCl) – L°m (NaCl) = L°m (KBr) – L°m (NaBr)
= L°m (KI) – L°m (NaI) ≃ 23.4 S cm2 mol–1
and similarly it was found that
L°m (NaBr)– L°m (NaCl) = L°m (KBr) – L°m (KCl) ≃ 1.8 S cm2 mol–1
On the basis of the above observations he enunciated Kohlrausch
law of independent migration of ions. The law states that limiting
molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the
individual contributions of the anion and cation of the electrolyte. Thus,
if l°Na+ and l°Cl– are limiting molar conductivity of the sodium and chloride
ions respectively, then the limiting molar conductivity for sodium chloride
is given by the equation:
(2.24)
L°m (NaCl) = l°Na+ + l°Cl–
In general, if an electrolyte on dissociation gives n+ cations and n–
anions then its limiting molar conductivity is given by:

L°m = n+ l°+ + n– l°–

(2.25)

Here, l°+ and l°– are the limiting molar conductivities of the cation
and anion respectively. The values of l° for some cations and anions at
298 K are given in Table 2.4.

Weak Electrolytes

Weak electrolytes like acetic acid have lower degree of dissociation at
higher concentrations and hence for such electrolytes, the change in Lm
with dilution is due to increase in the degree of dissociation and
consequently the number of ions in total volume of solution that contains
1 mol of electrolyte. In such cases Lm increases steeply (Fig. 2.6) on
dilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, L°m cannot be
obtained by extrapolation of Lm to zero concentration. At infinite dilution
(i.e., concentration c ® zero) electrolyte dissociates completely (a =1),
but at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low
that it cannot be measured accurately. Therefore, L°m for weak electrolytes
is obtained by using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions
(Example 2.8). At any concentration c, if a is the degree of dissociation

2.5 Electrolytic
Cells and
Electrolysis

In an electrolytic cell external source of voltage is used to bring about
a chemical reaction. The electrochemical processes are of great importance
in the laboratory and the chemical industry. One of the simplest electrolytic
cell consists of two copper strips dipping in an aqueous solution of
copper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then
Cu 2+ ions discharge at the cathode (negatively charged) and the following
reaction takes place:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e– ® Cu (s)
(2.28)
Copper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is
converted into Cu2+ ions by the reaction:
Cu(s) ® Cu2+(s) + 2e–
(2.29)
Thus copper is dissolved (oxidised) at anode and deposited
(reduced) at cathode. This is the basis for an industrial process in
which impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The
impure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current
and pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg,
Al, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of
their respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents
are available for this purpose.
Sodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of
their fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of
aluminium oxide in presence of cryolite.
Quantitative Aspects of Electrolysis

Michael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative
aspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday’s laws also flow from what has
been discussed earlier.
Faraday’s Laws of Electrolysis

After his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts
of electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833-34 in the
form of the following well known Faraday’s two laws of electrolysis:
(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any
electrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the
quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte (solution or
melt).
(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the
same quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution
are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass
of Metal ÷ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation).
51

Electrochemistry

Rationalised 2023-24

There were no constant current sources available during Faraday’s
times. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic
cell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount
of metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However,
coulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current (I)
sources available and the quantity of electricity Q, passed is given by
Q = It
Q is in coloumbs when I is in ampere and t is in second.
The amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or
reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For
example, in the reaction:
Ag +(aq) + e– ® Ag(s)
(2.30)
One mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole
of silver ions.
We know that charge on one electron is equal to 1.6021 × 10–19C.
Therefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to:
NA × 1.6021 × 10–19 C = 6.02 × 1023 mol–1 × 1.6021 × 10–19
C = 96487 C mol–1
This quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by
the symbol F.
For approximate calculations we use 1F ≃ 96500 C mol–1.
For the electrode reactions:
Mg2+(l) + 2e– ¾® Mg(s)
(2.31)
Al3+(l) + 3e– ¾® Al(s)
(2.32)
2+
3+
It is obvious that one mole of Mg and Al require 2 mol of electrons
(2F) and 3 mol of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through
the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current
in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals,
current as high as 50,000 amperes are used that amounts to about
0.518 F per second.

Example 2.10 A solution of CuSO4 is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of

1.5 amperes. What is the mass of copper deposited at the cathode?

Solution t = 600 s charge = current × time = 1.5 A × 600 s = 900 C
According to the reaction:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e– = Cu(s)
We require 2F or 2 × 96487 C to deposit 1 mol or 63 g of Cu.
For 900 C, the mass of Cu deposited
= (63 g mol–1 × 900 C)/(2 × 96487 C mol–1) = 0.2938 g.
2.5.1 Products of
Electrolysis

Chemistry

Products of electrolysis depend on the nature of material being
electrolysed and the type of electrodes being used. If the electrode is
inert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical
reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other
hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction.
Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert

52

Rationalised 2023-24

electrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising
and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard
electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes
although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do
not seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential) has to
be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur.
For example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are
sodium metal and Cl2 gas. Here we have only one cation (Na+) which is
reduced at the cathode (Na+ + e– ® Na) and one anion (Cl–) which is
oxidised at the anode (Cl– ® ½Cl2 + e–). During the electrolysis of aqueous
sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, Cl2 and H2. In this
case besides Na+ and Cl– ions we also have H+ and OH– ions along with
the solvent molecules, H2O.
At the cathode there is competition between the following reduction
reactions:
Na+ (aq) + e– ® Na (s)

E(ocell ) = – 2.71 V

H+ (aq) + e– ® ½ H2 (g)

E(ocell ) = 0.00 V

The reaction with higher value of E o is preferred and therefore, the
reaction at the cathode during electrolysis is:
H+ (aq) + e– ® ½ H2 (g)
(2.33)
but H+ (aq) is produced by the dissociation of H2O, i.e.,
H2O (l ) ® H+ (aq) + OH– (aq)

(2.34)

Therefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum
of (2.33) and (2.34) and we have
H2O (l ) + e– ® ½H2(g) + OH–
(2.35)
At the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible:
Cl– (aq) ® ½ Cl2 (g) + e–

E(ocell ) = 1.36 V

(2.36)

2H2O (l ) ® O2 (g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e–

E(ocell ) = 1.23 V

(2.37)

The reaction at anode with lower value of E o is preferred and
therefore, water should get oxidised in preference to Cl– (aq). However,
on account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction (2.36) is preferred. Thus,
the net reactions may be summarised as:
H O

NaCl (aq) 
Cathode:

Anode:
Cl– (aq) ® ½ Cl2(g) + e–
Net reaction:
NaCl(aq) + H2O(l ) ® Na+(aq) + OH–(aq) + ½H2(g) + ½Cl2(g)

The standard electrode potentials are replaced by electrode potentials
given by Nernst equation (Eq. 2.8) to take into account the concentration
effects. During the electrolysis of sulphuric acid, the following processes
are possible at the anode:
2H2O(l ) ® O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e–

E(ocell ) = +1.23 V

concentrations of H2SO4, reaction (2.39) is preferred.

2.6 Batteries

Any battery (actually it may have one or more than one cell connected
in series) or cell that we use as a source of electrical energy is basically
a galvanic cell where the chemical energy of the redox reaction is
converted into electrical energy. However, for a battery to be of practical
use it should be reasonably light, compact and its voltage should not
vary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries.

In the primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use
over a period of time battery becomes dead and cannot be reused
again. The most familiar example of this type is the dry
cell (known as Leclanche cell after its discoverer) which is
used commonly in our transistors and clocks. The cell
consists of a zinc container that also acts as anode and
the cathode is a carbon (graphite) rod surrounded by
powdered manganese dioxide and carbon (Fig.2.8). The
space between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of
ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and zinc chloride (ZnCl2). The
electrode reactions are complex, but they can be written
approximately as follows :
Anode:
Zn(s) ¾® Zn2+ + 2e–
Cathode: MnO2+ NH4++ e–¾® MnO(OH) + NH3
In the reaction at cathode, manganese is reduced
from the + 4 oxidation state to the +3 state. Ammonia
produced in the reaction forms a complex with Zn2+ to give
[Zn (NH3)4]2+. The cell has a potential of nearly 1.5 V.
Mercury cell, (Fig. 2.9) suitable for low current devices
like hearing aids, watches, etc. consists of zinc – mercury
amalgam as anode and a paste of HgO and carbon as the

2.6.2 Secondary
Batteries

A secondary cell after use can be recharged by passing current
through it in the opposite direction so that it can be used again. A
good secondary cell can undergo a large number of discharging
and charging cycles. The most important secondary cell is the lead
storage battery (Fig. 2.10) commonly used in automobiles and
invertors. It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with
lead dioxide (PbO 2 ) as cathode. A 38% solution of sulphuric acid
is used as an electrolyte.
The cell reactions when the battery is in use are given below:
Anode:

Pb(s) + SO42–(aq) ® PbSO4(s) + 2e–

Cathode: PbO2(s) + SO42–(aq) + 4H+(aq) + 2e– ® PbSO4 (s) + 2H2O (l )
i.e., overall cell reaction consisting of cathode and anode reactions is:
Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 2H2SO4(aq) ® 2PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(l)
On charging the battery the reaction is reversed and PbSO4(s) on
anode and cathode is converted into Pb and PbO2, respectively.

2.7 Fuel Cells

Production of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method
and is a major source of pollution. In such plants, the chemical energy
(heat of combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, gas or oil) is first used for
converting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run
a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly
converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is
now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously
to the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the
electrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert
the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol,
etc. directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells.
One of the most successful fuel cells
uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen
to form water (Fig. 2.12). The cell was
used for providing electrical power in the
Apollo space programme. The water
vapours produced during the reaction
were condensed and added to the
drinking water supply for the astronauts.
In the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are
bubbled through porous carbon
electrodes into concentrated aqueous
sodium hydroxide solution. Catalysts like
finely divided platinum or palladium
metal are incorporated into the electrodes
for increasing the rate of electrode

to thermal plants whose efficiency is about 40%. There has been
tremendous progress in the development of new electrode materials,
better catalysts and electrolytes for increasing the efficiency of fuel cells.
These have been used in automobiles on an experimental basis. Fuel
cells are pollution free and in view of their future importance, a variety
of fuel cells have been fabricated and tried.

2.8 Corrosion

Corrosion slowly coats the surfaces of metallic objects with oxides or
other salts of the metal. The rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver,
development of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the
examples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to
buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of
metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees
every year on account of corrosion.
In corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons
to oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron
(commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of
water and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite
complex but it may be considered

Anode: 2 Fe (s) ¾® 2 Fe2+ + 4 e–

E o(Fe2+/Fe) = – 0.44 V

Electrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go
to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of H+
(which is believed to be available from H2CO3 formed due to dissolution
of carbon dioxide from air into water. Hydrogen ion in water may also
be available due to dissolution of other acidic oxides from the
atmosphere). This spot behaves as cathode with the reaction

= 1.23 V

E o(cell) =1.67 V

The ferrous ions are further oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to
ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide
(Fe2O3. x H2O) and with further production of hydrogen ions.
Prevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves
money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse
or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest
methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic
object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering
the surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another
simple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that
are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to
provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which
corrodes itself but saves the object.

The Hydrogen Economy
At present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels
such as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their
standard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per
capita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it
is assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted.
We are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil
fuels is resulting in the ‘Greenhouse Effect’. This is leading to a rise in the
temperature of the Earth’s surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels
to rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations
such as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope,
we need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal
alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must
come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used
as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the
Hydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water
and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And
both these technologies are based on electrochemical principles.

Summary
An electrochemical cell consists of two metallic electrodes dipping in electrolytic
solution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic
conductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell,
the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical
work, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a nonspontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode
dipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode
potential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell
can be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and
o
anode ( E(cell ) = E ocathode – E oanode). The standard potential of the cells are

of the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation.
The conductivity, k, of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration
of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, Lm, is
defined by = k/c where c is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar
conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with
decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep
for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar
conductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the

molar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of
independent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity
through the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the
electrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful
forms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical
phenomenon. Electrochemical principles are relevant to the Hydrogen Economy.

Chemical Kinetics helps us to understand how chemical reactions
occur.

Chemistry, by its very nature, is concerned with change.
Substances with well defined properties are converted
by chemical reactions into other substances with
different properties. For any chemical reaction, chemists
try to find out
(a) the feasibility of a chemical reaction which can be
predicted by thermodynamics ( as you know that a
reaction with DG < 0, at constant temperature and
pressure is feasible);
(b) extent to which a reaction will proceed can be
determined from chemical equilibrium;
(c) speed of a reaction i.e. time taken by a reaction to
reach equilibrium.
Along with feasibility and extent, it is equally
important to know the rate and the factors controlling
the rate of a chemical reaction for its complete
understanding. For example, which parameters
determine as to how rapidly food gets spoiled? How
to design a rapidly setting material for dental filling?
Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an
auto engine? All these questions can be answered by
the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study
of reaction rates and their mechanisms, called
chemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from
the Greek word ‘kinesis’ meaning movement.
Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a
reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate
of a reaction. For example, thermodynamic data
indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but
in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change
is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think

that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine
the speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the
conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors
such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the
rate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in
amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or
formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving
orientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions,
are discussed.
In this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous
rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary
ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given.
However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the
reaction rate.

3 . 1 Rate of a
Chemical
Reaction

Some reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example,
precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of
aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. On the other
hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in
the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion
of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate
speed. Can you think of more examples from each category?
You must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in
terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain
period of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a
reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant
or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in
terms of:
(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the
reactants, or
(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products.
Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the
system remains constant.
R ® P
One mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P. If
[R]1 and [P]1 are the concentrations of R and P respectively at time t1
and [R]2 and [P]2 are their concentrations at time t2 then,
Dt

= t2 – t1

D[R] = [R]2 – [R]1
D [P] = [P]2 – [P]1
The square brackets in the above expressions are used to express
molar concentration.

Since, D[R] is a negative quantity (as concentration of reactants is
decreasing), it is multiplied with –1 to make the rate of the reaction a
positive quantity.
Equations (3.1) and (3.2) given above represent the average rate of
a reaction, rav.
Average rate depends upon the change in concentration of reactants
or products and the time taken for that change to occur (Fig. 3.1).

Units of rate of a reaction

From equations (3.1) and (3.2), it is clear that units of rate are
concentration time–1. For example, if concentration is in mol L–1 and
time is in seconds then the units will be mol L-1s–1. However, in gaseous
reactions, when the concentration of gases is expressed in terms of their
partial pressures, then the units of the rate equation will be atm s–1.
From the concentrations of C4H9Cl (butyl chloride) at different times given Example 3.1

We can determine the difference in concentration over different intervals
of time and thus determine the average rate by dividing D[R] by Dt
(Table 3.1).

It can be seen (Table 3.1) that the average rate falls from 1.90 × 0-4 mol L-1s-1 to
0.4 × 10-4 mol L-1s-1. However, average rate cannot be used to predict the
rate of a reaction at a particular instant as it would be constant for the
time interval for which it is calculated. So, to express the rate at a particular
moment of time we determine the instantaneous rate. It is obtained
when we consider the average rate at the smallest time interval say dt ( i.e.
when Dt approaches zero). Hence, mathematically for an infinitesimally
small dt instantaneous rate is given by

It can be determined graphically by drawing a tangent at time t on
either of the curves for concentration of R and P vs time t and calculating
its slope (Fig. 3.1). So in problem 3.1, rinst at 600s for example, can be
calculated by plotting concentration of butyl chloride as a function of
time. A tangent is drawn that touches the curve at t = 600 s (Fig. 3.2).
The slope of this tangent gives the instantaneous rate.
mol L–1 = 5.12 × 10–5 mol L–1s–1

So, rinst at 600 s = –
At t = 250 s

rinst = 1.22 × 10–4 mol L–1s–1

t = 350 s

rinst = 1.0 × 10–4 mol L–1s–1

t = 450 s

rinst = 6.4 ×× 10–5 mol L–1s–1

Now consider a reaction
Hg(l) + Cl2 (g) ® HgCl2(s)
Where stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products are
same, then rate of the reaction is given as

Rate of reaction = –

i.e., rate of disappearance of any of the reactants is same as the rate
of appearance of the products. But in the following reaction, two moles of
HI decompose to produce one mole each of H2 and I2,
2HI(g) ® H2(g) + I2(g)
For expressing the rate of such a reaction where stoichiometric
coefficients of reactants or products are not equal to one, rate of
disappearance of any of the reactants or the rate of appearance of
products is divided by their respective stoichiometric coefficients. Since
rate of consumption of HI is twice the rate of formation of H2 or I2, to
make them equal, the term D[HI] is divided by 2. The rate of this reaction
is given by
Rate of reaction = −

For a gaseous reaction at constant temperature, concentration is

can also be expressed as rate of change in partial pressure of the reactant

3.2 Factors Influencing
Rate of a Reaction

Rate of reaction depends upon the experimental conditions such
as concentration of reactants (pressure in case of gases),
temperature and catalyst.

3.2.1 Dependence
of Rate on
Concentration

The rate of a chemical reaction at a given temperature may depend on
the concentration of one or more reactants and products. The
representation of rate of reaction in terms of concentration of the
reactants is known as rate law. It is also called as rate equation or
rate expression.

3.2.2 Rate
Expression
and Rate
Constant

The results in Table 3.1 clearly show that rate of a reaction decreases with
the passage of time as the concentration of reactants decrease. Conversely,
rates generally increase when reactant concentrations increase. So, rate of
a reaction depends upon the concentration of reactants.

and products.
The rate expression for this reaction is

This form of equation (3.4 b) is known as differential rate equation,
where k is a proportionality constant called rate constant. The
equation like (3.4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration
of reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus, rate law is the
expression in which reaction rate is given in terms of molar
concentration of reactants with each term raised to some
power, which may or may not be same as the stoichiometric
coefficient of the reacting species in a balanced chemical
equation. For example:
2NO(g) + O2(g) ® 2NO2 (g)
We can measure the rate of this reaction as a function of initial
concentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants
constant and changing the concentration of the other reactant or by
changing the concentration of both the reactants. The following results
are obtained (Table 3.2).

It is obvious, after looking at the results, that when the concentration
of NO is doubled and that of O2 is kept constant then the initial rate
increases by a factor of four from 0.096 to 0.384 mol L–1s–1. This
indicates that the rate depends upon the square of the concentration of
NO. When concentration of NO is kept constant and concentration of
O2 is doubled the rate also gets doubled indicating that rate depends
on concentration of O2 to the first power. Hence, the rate equation for
this reaction will be

Rate = k [NO] [O2]

The differential form of this rate expression is given as

Now, we observe that for this reaction in the rate equation derived
from the experimental data, the exponents of the concentration terms
are the same as their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced
chemical equation.
Some other examples are given below:

2. CH3COOC2H5 + H2O ® CH3COOH + C2H5OH Rate = k [CH3COOC2H5] [H2O]
In these reactions, the exponents of the concentration terms are not
the same as their stoichiometric coefficients. Thus, we can say that:
Rate law for any reaction cannot be predicted by merely looking at
the balanced chemical equation, i.e., theoretically but must be determined
experimentally.
3.2.3 Order of a
Reaction

In the rate equation (3.4)
Rate = k [A]x [B]y
x and y indicate how sensitive the rate is to the change in concentration
of A and B. Sum of these exponents, i.e., x + y in (3.4) gives the overall
order of a reaction whereas x and y represent the order with respect
to the reactants A and B respectively.
Hence, the sum of powers of the concentration of the
reactants in the rate law expression is called the order of that
chemical reaction.
Order of a reaction can be 0, 1, 2, 3 and even a fraction. A zero
order reaction means that the rate of reaction is independent of the
concentration of reactants.

Example 3.3 Calculate the overall order of a reaction which

Solution

has the rate expression
(a) Rate = k [A]1/2 [B]3/2
(b) Rate = k [A]3/2 [B]–1

(a) Rate = k [A]x [B]y
order = x + y
So order = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, i.e., second order
(b) order = 3/2 + (–1) = 1/2, i.e., half order.

A balanced chemical equation never gives us a true picture of how
a reaction takes place since rarely a reaction gets completed in one
step. The reactions taking place in one step are called elementary
reactions. When a sequence of elementary reactions (called mechanism)
gives us the products, the reactions are called complex reactions.

(ii) The unit of a first order rate constant is s–1 therefore
k = 3 × 10–4 s–1 represents a first order reaction.

3.2.4 Molecularity
of a
Reaction

Another property of a reaction called molecularity helps in
understanding its mechanism.
The number of reacting species
(atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary
reaction, which must collide simultaneously in order to bring
about a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction.
The reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved,
for example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite.

NH4NO2 ® N2 + 2H2O
Bimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two
species, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide.
2HI ® H2 + I2
Trimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision
between three reacting species, for example,
2NO + O2 ® 2NO2
The probability that more than three molecules can collide and
react simultaneously is very small. Hence, reactions with the
molecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed.
It is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than
three molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more
than one step.
KClO3 + 6FeSO4 + 3H2SO4 ® KCl + 3Fe2(SO4)3 + 3H2O
This reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually
a second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in
several steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The
question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction,
for example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team
depend upon the slowest person in the team. Similarly, the overall rate
of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the
rate determining step. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium.

Alkaline medium

The rate equation for this reaction is found to be

d  H2O2 

 k  H2 O2  I 
dt
This reaction is first order with respect to both H2O2 and I–. Evidences
suggest that this reaction takes place in two steps
Rate 

(1) H2O2 + I– ® H2O + IO–
(2) H2O2 + IO– ® H2O + I– + O2
Both the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO- is
called as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the
reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being
slow, is the rate determining step. Thus, the rate of formation of
intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction.
Thus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following:
(i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and
even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.
(ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions
whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions.
For complex reaction molecularity has no meaning.

reaction.

3 . 3 Integrated
Rate
Equations

We have already noted that the concentration dependence of rate is
called differential rate equation. It is not always convenient to
determine the instantaneous rate, as it is measured by determination
of slope of the tangent at point ‘t’ in concentration vs time plot
(Fig. 3.1). This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence
the order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can
integrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly
measured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times
and rate constant.
The integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different
reaction orders. We shall determine these equations only for zero and
first order chemical reactions.

3.3.1 Zero Order
Reactions

Zero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is proportional
to zero power of the concentration of reactants. Consider the reaction,
R ® P
d R 
 k  R 0
Rate = 
dt
As any quantity raised to power zero is unity
d R 
k ×1
dt
d[R] = – k dt

Rate = 

Integrating both sides
[R] = – k t + I
(3.5)
where, I is the constant of integration.
At t = 0, the concentration of the reactant R = [R]0, where [R]0 is
initial concentration of the reactant.
Substituting in equation (3.5)
[R]0 = –k × 0 + I
[R]0 = I
Substituting the value of I in the equation (3.5)
[R] = -kt + [R]0

(3.6)

Comparing (3.6) with equation of a straight line,
y = mx + c, if we plot [R] against t, we get a straight
line (Fig. 3.3) with slope = –k and intercept equal
to [R]0.
Further simplifying equation (3.6), we get the rate
constant, k as

Zero order reactions are relatively uncommon but
they occur under special conditions. Some enzyme
catalysed reactions and reactions which occur on
metal surfaces are a few examples of zero order
reactions. The decomposition of gaseous ammonia
on a hot platinum surface is a zero order reaction at
high pressure.

2NH3 ( g ) 
→ N 2 ( g ) +3H2 ( g )
Pt catalyst

Rate = k [NH3]0 = k
In this reaction, platinum metal acts as a catalyst. At high pressure,
the metal surface gets saturated with gas molecules. So, a further
change in reaction conditions is unable to alter the amount of ammonia
on the surface of the catalyst making rate of the reaction independent
of its concentration. The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface
is another example of zero order reaction.
3.3.2 First Order
Reactions

In this class of reactions, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the
first power of the concentration of the reactant R. For example,
R ® P
Rate = −

or

d [R ]
= k [R ]
dt

d [R ]
= –kdt
[R ]

Integrating this equation, we get
ln [R] = – kt + I

(3.8)

Again, I is the constant of integration and its value can be determined
easily.
When t = 0, R = [R]0, where [R]0 is the initial concentration of the
reactant.
Therefore, equation (3.8) can be written as
ln [R]0 = –k × 0 + I
ln [R]0 = I
Substituting the value of I in equation (3.8)
ln[R] = –kt + ln[R]0

The half-life of a reaction is the time in which the concentration of a
reactant is reduced to one half of its initial concentration. It is
represented as t1/2.

It can be seen that for a first order reaction, half-life period is
constant, i.e., it is independent of initial concentration of the reacting
species. The half-life of a first order equation is readily calculated from
the rate constant and vice versa.

t1/2 is independent of [R]0.

The order of a reaction is sometimes altered by conditions. There
are many reactions which obey first order rate law although they are
higher order reactions. Consider the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate which
is a chemical reaction between ethyl acetate and water. In reality, it
is a second order reaction and concentration of both ethyl acetate and
water affect the rate of the reaction. But water is taken in large excess
for hydrolysis, therefore, concentration of water is not altered much
during the reaction. Thus, the rate of reaction is affected by
concentration of ethyl acetate only. For example, during the hydrolysis
of 0.01 mol of ethyl acetate with 10 mol of water, amounts of the
reactants and products at the beginning (t = 0) and completion (t) of
the reaction are given as under.

Dependence of
the Rate of a
Reaction

Chemistry

Most of the chemical reactions are accelerated by increase in temperature.
For example, in decomposition of N2O5, the time taken for half of the
original amount of material to decompose is 12 min at 50oC, 5 h at
25oC and 10 days at 0oC. You also know that in a mixture of potassium
permanganate (KMnO 4) and oxalic acid (H2 C 2O4 ), potassium
permanganate gets decolourised faster at a higher temperature than
that at a lower temperature.
It has been found that for a chemical reaction with rise in
temperature by 10°, the rate constant is nearly doubled.
The temperature dependence of the rate of a chemical reaction can
be accurately explained by Arrhenius equation (3.18). It was first
proposed by Dutch chemist, J.H. van’t Hoff but Swedish chemist,
Arrhenius provided its physical justification and interpretation.

(3.18)
where A is the Arrhenius factor or the frequency factor. It is also called
pre-exponential factor. It is a constant specific to a particular reaction.
R is gas constant and Ea is activation energy measured in joules/mole
(J mol –1).
It can be understood clearly using the following simple reaction
H 2  g   I2  g   2HI  g 

According to Arrhenius, this reaction can take place

for a very short time and then breaks up to form two Fig. 3.6: Formation of HI through

the intermediate
The energy required to form this
intermediate, called activated complex
(C), is known as activation energy (Ea).
Fig. 3.7 is obtained by plotting potential
energy vs reaction coordinate. Reaction
coordinate represents the profile of energy
change when reactants change into
products.
Some energy is released when the
complex decomposes to form products.
So, the final enthalpy of the reaction
depends upon the nature of reactants
and products.
All the molecules in the reacting
species do not have the same kinetic
Fig. 3.7: Diagram showing plot of potential
energy. Since it is difficult to predict the
energy vs reaction coordinate
behaviour of any one molecule with
precision, Ludwig Boltzmann and James
Clark Maxwell used statistics to predict
the behaviour of large number of
molecules. According to them, the
distribution of kinetic energy may be
described by plotting the fraction of
molecules (NE/NT) with a given kinetic
energy (E) vs kinetic energy (Fig. 3.8).
Here, NE is the number of molecules with
energy E and N T is total number
of molecules.
The peak of the curve corresponds to
the most probable kinetic energy, i.e.,
kinetic energy of maximum fraction of
molecules. There are decreasing number

temperature is raised, the maximum
of the curve moves to the higher
energy value (Fig. 3.9) and the curve
broadens out, i.e., spreads to the right
such that there is a greater proportion
of molecules with much higher
energies. The area under the curve
must be constant since total
probability must be one at all times.
We can mark the position of Ea on
Maxwell Boltzmann distribution curve
(Fig. 3.9).

Increasing the temperature of the substance increases the fraction
of molecules, which collide with energies greater than Ea. It is clear
from the diagram that in the curve at (t + 10), the area showing the
fraction of molecules having energy equal to or greater than activation
energy gets doubled leading to doubling the rate of a reaction.
In the Arrhenius equation (3.18) the factor e -Ea /RT corresponds to
the fraction of molecules that have kinetic energy greater than Ea.

The plot of ln k vs 1/T gives a straight line according to the equation
(3.19) as shown in Fig. 3.10.

increasing the temperature or decreasing the activation energy will
result in an increase in the rate of the reaction and an exponential

3.4.1 Effect of
Catalyst

A catalyst is a substance which increases the rate of a reaction without
itself undergoing any permanent chemical change. For example, MnO2
catalyses the following reaction so as to increase its rate considerably.
MnO2
2KClO3 
2 KCl + 3O2

The word catalyst should not be used when the added substance
reduces the rate of raction. The substance is then called inhibitor. The
action of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory.
According to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by
forming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate
complex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products
and the catalyst.
It is believed that the catalyst provides an
alternate pathway or reaction mechanism by
reducing the activation energy between
reactants and products and hence lowering
the potential energy barrier as shown in
Fig. 3.11.
It is clear from Arrhenius equation (3.18)
that lower the value of activation energy faster
will be the rate of a reaction.
A small amount of the catalyst can catalyse
a
large
amount of reactants. A catalyst does

energy
catalyses the spontaneous reactions but does
not catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is
also found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of
a reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it
catalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same
extent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier.

3.5 Collision
Theory of
Chemical
Reactions
Chemistry

Though Arrhenius equation is applicable under a wide range of
circumstances, collision theory, which was developed by Max Trautz
and William Lewis in 1916 -18, provides a greater insight into the
energetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions. It is based on kinetic
theory of gases. According to this theory, the reactant molecules are

82

assumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when
molecules collide with each other. The number of collisions per
second per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as
collision frequency (Z). Another factor which affects the rate of
chemical reactions is activation energy (as we have already studied).
For a bimolecular elementary reaction
A + B ® Products
rate of reaction can be expressed as
(3.23)
Rate = Z AB e− Ea / RT
where ZAB represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B
-Ea /RT
represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to
and e
or greater than Ea. Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can
say that A is related to collision frequency.
Equation (3.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly
accurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple
molecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are
observed. The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the
formation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with
sufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy*) and proper
orientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting
species and formation of new bonds to form products are called as
effective collisions.
For example, formation of
methanol from bromoethane depends
upon the orientation of reactant
molecules
as
shown
in
Fig. 3.12. The proper orientation of
reactant molecules lead to bond
formation
whereas
improper
orientation makes them simply
bounce back and no products are
formed.
Fig. 3.12: Diagram showing molecules having proper and
To account for effective collisions,
improper orientation
another factor P, called the probability
or steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a
collision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e.,

Rate = PZ AB e− Ea / RT
Thus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of
the molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision
and hence the rate of a chemical reaction.
Collision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms/
molecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect. You
will study details about this theory and more on other theories in your
higher classes.
* Threshold energy = Activation Energy + energy possessed by reacting species.

Summary
Chemical kinetics is the study of chemical reactions with respect to reaction
rates, effect of various variables, rearrangement of atoms and formation of
intermediates. The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration
of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can
be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average
rate over a large interval of time. A number of factors such as temperature,
concentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical
representation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law. It has to be determined
experimentally and cannot be predicted. Order of a reaction with respect to
a reactant is the power of its concentration which appears in the rate law
equation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration
of terms for different reactants. Rate constant is the proportionality factor in
the rate law. Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate
law or its integrated rate equation. Molecularity is defined only for an elementary
reaction. Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or
even a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same.
Temperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation
(k = Ae –Ea/RT). Ea corresponds to the activation energy and is given by the
energy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and A
(Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor) corresponds to the collision frequency.
The equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of Ea will
lead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the
activation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction. According to
collision theory, another factor P called steric factor which refers to the orientation
of molecules which collide, is important and contributes to effective collisions,
thus, modifying the Arrhenius equation to k  P Z ABe  E a / RT .

4
Objectives
After studying this Unit, you will be
able to
• learn the positions of the d– and
f-block elements in the periodic
table;
• know the electronic configurations
of the transition (d-block) and the
inner transition (f-block) elements;
• appreciate the relative stability of
various oxidation states in terms
of electrode potential values;
• describe
the
preparation,
properties, structures and uses
of some important compounds
such as K2Cr2O7 and KMnO4;
• understand
the
general
characteristics of the d– and
f–block elements and the general
horizontal and group trends in
them;
• describe the properties of the
f-block elements and give a
comparative account of the
lanthanoids and actinoids with
respect
to
their
electronic
configurations, oxidation states
and chemical behaviour.

The dd-- and ffBlock Elements
Iron, copper, silver and gold are among the transition elements that
have played important roles in the development of human civilisation.
The inner transition elements such as Th, Pa and U are proving
excellent sources of nuclear energy in modern times.

The d-block of the periodic table contains the elements
of the groups 3-12 in which the d orbitals are
progressively filled in each of the four long periods.
The f-block consists of elements in which 4 f and 5 f
orbitals are progressively filled. They are placed in a
separate panel at the bottom of the periodic table. The
names transition metals and inner transition metals
are often used to refer to the elements of d-and
f-blocks respectively.
There are mainly four series of the transition metals,
3d series (Sc to Zn), 4d series (Y to Cd), 5d series (La
and Hf to Hg) and 6d series which has Ac and elements
from Rf to Cn. The two series of the inner transition
metals; 4f (Ce to Lu) and 5f (Th to Lr) are known as
lanthanoids and actinoids respectively.
Originally the name transition metals was derived
from the fact that their chemical properties were
transitional between those of s and p-block elements.
Now according to IUPAC, transition metals are defined
as metals which have incomplete d subshell either in
neutral atom or in their ions. Zinc, cadmium and
10
mercury of group 12 have full d configuration in their
ground state as well as in their common oxidation states
and hence, are not regarded as transition metals.
However, being the end members of the 3d, 4d and 5d
transition series, respectively, their chemistry is studied
along with the chemistry of the transition metals.
The presence of partly filled d or f orbitals in their
atoms makes transition elements different from that of

the non-transition elements. Hence, transition elements
and their compounds are studied separately. However,
the usual theory of valence as applicable to the nontransition elements can be applied successfully to the
transition elements also.
Various precious metals such as silver, gold and
platinum and industrially important metals like iron,
copper and titanium belong to the transition metals series.
In this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic
configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of
transition elements with special emphasis on the trends
in the properties of the first row (3d) transition metals
along with the preparation and properties of some
important compounds. This will be followed by
consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic
configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity
of the inner transition metals.

THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK)

4.1 Position in the
Periodic Table

4.2 Electronic
Configurations
of the d-Block
Elements

The d–block occupies the large middle section of the periodic table
flanked between s– and p– blocks in the periodic table. The d–orbitals
of the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to
four rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, 4d, 5d and 6d. All these
series of transition elements are shown in Table 4.1.
In general the electronic configuration of outer orbitals of these elements
1– 10
1–2
is (n-1)d ns except for Pd where its electronic configuration is 4d105s0.
The (n–1) stands for the inner d orbitals which may have one to ten
electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons.
However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very
little energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals. Furthermore,
half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A
consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations
of Cr and Cu in the 3d series. For example, consider the case of Cr,
5
1
4
2
which has 3d 4s configuration instead of 3d 4s ; the energy gap
between the two sets (3d and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent
electron entering the 3d orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the
10
1
9
2
configuration is 3d 4s and not 3d 4s . The ground state electronic
configurations of the outer orbitals of transition elements are given in
Table 4.1.

The electronic configurations of outer orbitals of Zn, Cd, Hg and Cn
10
2
are represented by the general formula (n-1)d ns . The orbitals in
these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in
their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as
transition elements.
The d orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of
an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and p), hence, they are more
influenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules
n
surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given d configuration
(n = 1 – 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly
filled d orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties
such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured
ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands.
The transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic
property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have
been discussed in detail later in this Unit.
There are greater similarities in the properties of the transition
elements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non-transition elements.
However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the
general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows
(particularly 3d row) and then consider some group similarities.
On what ground can you say that scandium (Z = 21) is a transition
element but zinc (Z = 30) is not?

Example 4.1

On the basis of incompletely filled 3d orbitals in case of scandium atom
1
in its ground state (3d ), it is regarded as a transition element. On the
10
other hand, zinc atom has completely filled d orbitals (3d ) in its
ground state as well as in its oxidised state, hence it is not regarded
as a transition element.

Fig. 4.1: Trends in melting points of
transition elements
Chemistry

The transition metals (with the exception
of Zn, Cd and Hg) are very hard and have low
volatility. Their melting and boiling points are
high. Fig. 4.1 depicts the melting points of
transition metals belonging to 3d, 4d and 5d
series. The high melting points of these metals
are attributed to the involvement of greater
number of electrons from (n-1)d in addition to
the ns electrons in the interatomic metallic
bonding. In any row the melting points of these
5
metals rise to a maximum at d except for
anomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall
regularly as the atomic number increases.
They have high enthalpies of atomisation which
are shown in Fig. 4.2. The maxima at about
the middle of each series indicate that one
unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly

favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the
number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since
the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the
standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy
of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their
reactions (see later for electrode potentials).
Another generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4.2 is that the
metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of
atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an
important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent
metal – metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals.

4.3.2 Variation in
Atomic and
Ionic Sizes
of
Transition
Metals

In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive
decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the
new electron enters a d orbital each time the nuclear charge increases
by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a d electron is
not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the
nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic
radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a
given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An
interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared
with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves
in Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first (3d) to the second (4d) series
of the elements but the radii of the third (5d) series are virtually the
same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This
phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4f orbitals which
must be filled before the 5d series of elements begin. The filling of 4f
before 5d orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called
Lanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected
93

Radius/nm

increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result
of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third d series
exhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar
physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on
the basis of usual family relationship.
19
The factor responsible for the lanthanoid
contraction is somewhat similar to that observed
18
in an ordinary transition series and is attributed
17
to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of
one electron by another in the same set of orbitals.
16
However, the shielding of one 4f electron by
15
another is less than that of one d electron by
14
another, and as the nuclear charge increases
along the series, there is fairly regular decrease
13
in the size of the entire 4f n orbitals.

Why do the transition elements exhibit higher enthalpies of
atomisation?

Example 4.2

Because of large number of unpaired electrons in their atoms they
have stronger interatomic interaction and hence stronger bonding
between atoms resulting in higher enthalpies of atomisation.

Solution

Intext Question
4.2 In the series Sc (Z = 21) to Zn (Z = 30), the enthalpy of atomisation
–1
of zinc is the lowest, i.e., 126 kJ mol . Why?

4.3.3 Ionisation
Enthalpies

There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the
transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear
charge which accompanies the filling of the inner d orbitals. Table
4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first
series of transition elements. These values show that the successive
enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case
of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along
a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation
along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy,
in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second
and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much
higher along a series.
The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of
3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for
by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies
of 4s and 3d orbitals. You have learnt that when d-block elements form
ions, ns electrons are lost before (n – 1) d electrons. As we move along
the period in 3d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from
scandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell,
i.e., 3d orbitals. These 3d electrons shield the 4s electrons from the
increasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer
shell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii
decrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly
n
along the 3d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have d
configurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values
of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge
increases because one d electron does not shield another electron from
the influence of nuclear charge because d-orbitals differ in direction.
However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation
enthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2+ and Fe3+ respectively. In both
the cases, ions have d5 configuration. Similar breaks occur at
corresponding elements in the later transition series.
The interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic
configuration dn is as follows:
The three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are
attraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the
95

electrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for
the stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately
proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in
the degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of
degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum
possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds
rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability
increases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of
exchange energy at d6 configuration. Mn+ has 3d54s1 configuration and
configuration of Cr+ is d5, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn+ is lower
than Cr+. In the same way, Fe2+ has d6 configuration and Mn2+ has 3d5
configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2+ is lower than the Mn2+.
In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is
lower than that of Mn.
The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To
2+
form the M ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and
second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of
atomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy
+
which shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M ions
5
10
have the d and d configurations respectively. The value for Zn is
correspondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4s
10
electron which results in the formation of stable d configuration.
The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by
the 4s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an
5
2+
10
2+
electron from the d (Mn ) and d (Zn ) ions. In general, the third
ionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third
ionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is
difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements.
Although ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the
relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and
not amenable to ready generalisation.
4.3.4 Oxidation
States

One of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety
of oxidation states these may show in their compounds. Table 4.3 lists

The elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states
occur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example,
exhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of
oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons
to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many d electrons (hence fewer orbitals
available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence
(Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown
and titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(III) or Ti(II). At the other end,
the only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no d electrons are involved). The
maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value
+
IV
V
to the sum of the s and d electrons upto manganese (Ti O2, V O2 ,

II,III
higher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are Fe ,
II,III
II
I,II
II
Co , Ni , Cu , Zn .
The variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition
elements, arises out of incomplete filling of d orbitals in such a way
II
III
that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., V , V ,
IV
V
V , V . This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non
transition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit
of two.
An interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the d–
block elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10).
Although in the p–block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the
heavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the
groups of d-block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and W(VI) are
found to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate
in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO3 and WO3
are not.
Low oxidation states are found when a complex compound has
ligands capable of p-acceptor character in addition to the s-bonding.
For example, in Ni(CO)4 and Fe(CO)5, the oxidation state of nickel and
iron is zero.

oxidation states.

Table 4.5 shows the stable halides of the 3d series of transition metals.

MnO3F is known, and beyond Mn no metal has a trihalide except FeX3

due to either higher lattice energy as in the case of CoF3, or higher bond
enthalpy terms for the higher covalent compounds, e.g., VF5 and CrF6.

The stability of Cu (aq) rather than Cu (aq) is due to the much

compensates for the second ionisation enthalpy of Cu.
The ability of oxygen to stabilise the highest oxidation state is
demonstrated in the oxides. The highest oxidation number in the oxides
(Table 4.6) coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc2O3
to Mn2O7. Beyond Group 7, no higher oxides of Fe above Fe2O3, are
known, although ferrates (VI)(FeO4)2–, are formed in alkaline media but
they readily decompose to Fe2O3 and O2. Besides the oxides, oxocations
stabilise Vv as VO2+, VIV as VO2+ and TiIV as TiO2+. The ability of oxygen
to stabilise these high oxidation states exceeds that of fluorine. Thus
the highest Mn fluoride is MnF4 whereas the highest oxide is Mn2O7.
The ability of oxygen to form multiple bonds to metals explains its
superiority. In the covalent oxide Mn2O7, each Mn is tetrahedrally
surrounded by O’s including a Mn–O–Mn bridge. The tetrahedral [MO4]nions are known for VV, CrVl, MnV, MnVl and MnVII.

4.3.8 Chemical
Reactivity
and Eo
Values

Transition metals vary widely in their chemical reactivity. Many of
them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although
a few are ‘noble’—that is, they are unaffected by single acids.
The metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively
more reactive and are oxidised by 1M H+, though the actual rate at
+
which these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion (H ) is
sometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are
passive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The E o values
for M2+/M (Table 4.2) indicate a decreasing tendency to form divalent
cations across the series. This general trend towards less negative E o
values is related to the increase in the sum of the first and second
ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the E o values for Mn,
Ni and Zn are more negative than expected from the general trend.

2+
Whereas the stabilities of half-filled d subshell (d ) in Mn and completely

e
filled d subshell (d ) in zinc are related to their E values; for nickel, E o
value is related to the highest negative enthalpy of hydration.

the irregular variation of ionisation enthalpies ( i H1   i H 2 ) and also
the sublimation enthalpies which are relatively much less for
manganese and vanadium.

Solution Much larger third ionisation energy of Mn (where the required change

4.3.9 Magnetic
Properties

When a magnetic field is applied to substances, mainly two types of
magnetic behaviour are observed: diamagnetism and paramagnetism.
Diamagnetic substances are repelled by the applied field while the
paramagnetic substances are attracted. Substances which are

attracted very strongly are said to be ferromagnetic. In fact,
ferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the
transition metal ions are paramagnetic.
Paramagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each
such electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular
momentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the
first series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular
momentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For
these, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired
electrons and is calculated by using the ‘spin-only’ formula, i.e.,
  n n  2

where n is the number of unpaired electrons and µ is the magnetic
moment in units of Bohr magneton (BM). A single unpaired electron
has a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM).
The magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of
unpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful
indication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom,
molecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the ‘spin-only’
formula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row
transition elements are given in Table 4.7. The experimental data are
mainly for hydrated ions in solution or in the solid state.

When an electron from a lower energy d orbital is excited to a higher
energy d orbital, the energy of excitation corresponds to the frequency
of light absorbed (Unit 5). This frequency generally lies in the visible
region. The colour observed corresponds to the complementary colour
of the light absorbed. The

dealt with in detail in Unit 5). The transition metals form a large
number of complex compounds. This is due to the comparatively
smaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the
availability of d orbitals for bond formation.
4.3.12 Catalytic
Properties

The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic
activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple
oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact
Process), finely divided iron (in Haber’s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic
Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface
involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms
of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3d and
4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the
concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening
of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering).
Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states,
they become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses
the reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.

4.3.13 Formation
of
Interstitial
Compounds

Interstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms
like H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are
usually non stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic nor covalent,
for example, TiC, Mn4N, Fe3H, VH0.56 and TiH1.7, etc. The formulas
quoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of
the metal. Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds
are referred to as interstitial compounds. The principal physical and
chemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows:
(i) They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals.
(ii) They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.
(iii) They retain metallic conductivity.
(iv) They are chemically inert.

4.3.14 Alloy
Formation

An alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components.
Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one
metal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such
alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15
percent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics
of transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The
alloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best
known are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum
and manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and
stainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals
such as brass (copper-zinc) and bronze (copper-tin), are also of
considerable industrial importance.

4 . 4 Some
Important
Compounds of
Transition
Elements

4.4.1 Oxides and Oxoanions of Metals
These oxides are generally formed by the reaction of metals with
oxygen at high temperatures. All the metals except scandium form
MO oxides which are ionic. The highest oxidation number in the
oxides, coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc2O3 to
Mn2O7. Beyond group 7, no higher oxides of iron above Fe2O3 are
V
+
IV
known. Besides the oxides, the oxocations stabilise V as VO2 , V as
2+
IV
2+
VO and Ti as TiO .
As the oxidation number of a metal increases, ionic character
decreases. In the case of Mn, Mn2O7 is a covalent green oil. Even CrO3
and V2O5 have low melting points. In these higher oxides, the acidic
character is predominant.
Thus, Mn2O7 gives HMnO4 and CrO3 gives H2CrO4 and H2Cr2O7.
3–
V2O5 is, however, amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives VO4 as
+
well as VO2 salts. In vanadium there is gradual change from the basic
V2O3 to less basic V2O4 and to amphoteric V2O5. V2O4 dissolves in acids
2+
to give VO salts. Similarly, V2O5 reacts with alkalies as well as acids
to give VO34 and VO4 respectively. The well characterised CrO is basic
but Cr2O3 is amphoteric.
Potassium dichromate K2Cr2O7

Potassium dichromate is a very important chemical used in leather
industry and as an oxidant for preparation of many azo compounds.
Dichromates are generally prepared from chromate, which in turn are
obtained by the fusion of chromite ore (FeCr2O4) with sodium or
potassium carbonate in free access of air. The reaction with sodium
carbonate occurs as follows:
4 FeCr2O4 + 8 Na2CO3 + 7 O2 ® 8 Na2CrO4 + 2 Fe2O3 + 8 CO2
The yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified
with sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium
dichromate, Na2Cr2O7. 2H2O can be crystallised.

Sodium dichromate is more soluble than potassium dichromate.
The latter is therefore, prepared by treating the solution of sodium
dichromate with potassium chloride.

Orange crystals of potassium dichromate crystallise out. The
chromates and dichromates are interconvertible in aqueous solution
depending upon pH of the solution. The oxidation state of chromium
in chromate and dichromate is the same.

are shown below. The
chromate ion is tetrahedral
whereas the dichromate ion
consists of two tetrahedra
sharing one corner with
Cr–O–Cr bond angle of 126°.
Sodium and potassium dichromates are strong oxidising agents;
the sodium salt has a greater solubility in water and is extensively
used as an oxidising agent in organic chemistry. Potassium dichromate
is used as a primary standard in volumetric analysis. In acidic solution,
its oxidising action can be represented as follows:
2–
+
–
3+
Cr2O7 + 14H + 6e ® 2Cr + 7H2O (E o = 1.33V)
Thus, acidified potassium dichromate will oxidise iodides to iodine,
sulphides to sulphur, tin(II) to tin(IV) and iron(II) salts to iron(III). The

Potassium permanganate KMnO4

Potassium permanganate is prepared by fusion of MnO2 with an alkali
metal hydroxide and an oxidising agent like KNO3. This produces the
dark green K2MnO4 which disproportionates in a neutral or acidic
solution to give permanganate.
2MnO2 + 4KOH + O2 ® 2K2MnO4 + 2H2O

(6.4 g/100 g of water at 293 K), but when heated it decomposes at 513 K.
2KMnO4 ® K2MnO4 + MnO2 + O2
It has two physical properties of considerable interest: its intense colour
and its diamagnetism along with temperature-dependent weak
paramagnetism. These can be explained by the use of molecular orbital
theory which is beyond the present scope.
The manganate and permanganate ions are tetrahedral; the pbonding takes place by overlap of p orbitals of oxygen with d orbitals
of manganese. The green manganate is paramagnetic because of one
unpaired electron but the permanganate is diamagnetic due to the
absence of unpaired electron.
Acidified permanganate solution oxidises oxalates to carbon dioxide,
iron(II) to iron(III), nitrites to nitrates and iodides to free iodine.

The full reaction can be written by adding the half-reaction for
KMnO4 to the half-reaction of the reducing agent, balancing wherever
necessary.

manganese dioxide and manganese(II) salt by half-reactions,

(E = + 1.52 V)
We can very well see that the hydrogen ion concentration of the
solution plays an important part in influencing the reaction. Although
many reactions can be understood by consideration of redox potential,
kinetics of the reaction is also an important factor. Permanganate at

[H ] = 1 should oxidise water but in practice the reaction is extremely slow
unless either manganese(ll) ions are present or the temperature is raised.

Uses
Uses: Besides its use in analytical chemistry, potassium permanganate is
used as a favourite oxidant in preparative organic chemistry. Its uses for the
bleaching of wool, cotton, silk and other textile fibres and for the decolourisation
of oils are also dependent on its strong oxidising power.

THE INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS ( f-BLOCK)
The f-block consists of the two series, lanthanoids (the fourteen elements
following lanthanum) and actinoids (the fourteen elements following
actinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is
usually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the
general symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids
includes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series.
The lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members
of ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable
oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to
examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a
series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on
the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly
owing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these
elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems
in their study; the two series will be considered separately here.

4.5 The
Lanthanoids

The names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some
ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids
(for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 4.9.

It may be noted that atoms of these elements have electronic
2
configuration with 6s common but with variable occupancy of 4f level
(Table 4.9). However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive
ions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the
form 4f n (n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number).

4.5.2 Atomic and
Ionic Sizes

The overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to
lutetium (the lanthanoid contraction) is a unique feature in the
chemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching
consequences in the chemistry of the third
Sm

transition series of the elements. The decrease
Eu
in atomic radii (derived from the structures of
metals) is not quite regular as it is regular in
La
3+
M ions (Fig. 4.6). This contraction is, of
Ce
course, similar to that observed in an ordinary
transition series and is attributed to the same
Pr
cause, the imperfect shielding of one electron

Nd
by another in the same sub-shell. However, the
Pm
shielding of one 4 f electron by another is less

than one d electron by another with the increase

4.5.3 Oxidation
States

In the lanthanoids, La(II) and Ln(III) compounds are predominant
species. However, occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid
compounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation
enthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled
IV
or filled f subshell. Thus, the formation of Ce is favoured by its
noble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the
4+
3+
common +3 state. The E o value for Ce / Ce is + 1.74 V which
suggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very
slow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy
2+
also exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO2. Eu is formed by losing
7
the two s electrons and its f configuration accounts for the formation
2+
of this ion. However, Eu is a strong reducing agent changing to the
2+
14
common +3 state. Similarly Yb which has f
configuration is a
IV
reductant. Tb has half-filled f-orbitals and is an oxidant. The
behaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both
+2 and +3 oxidation states.

4.5.4 General
Characteristics

All the lanthanoids are silvery white soft metals and tarnish rapidly in air.
The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being
steel hard. Their melting points range between 1000 to 1200 K but
samarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are
good conductors of heat and electricity. Density and other properties
change smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm.
Many trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state
and in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to
3+
3+
the presence of f electrons. Neither La nor Lu ion shows any colour
but the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably
because of the excitation within f level. The lanthanoid ions other
0

3+
than the f type (La and Ce ) and the f
type (Yb and Lu ) are
all paramagnetic.
The first ionisation enthalpies of the lanthanoids are around
–1
–1
600 kJ mol , the second about 1200 kJ mol comparable with those
of calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation
enthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in
3d orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain
degree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals
f level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third
ionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium.
In their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series
are quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number,
they behave more like aluminium. Values for E o for the half-reaction:

are in the range of –2.2 to –2.4 V
except for Eu for which the value is
– 2.0 V. This is, of course, a small
variation. The metals combine with
hydrogen when gently heated in the
gas. The carbides, Ln3C, Ln2C3 and LnC2
are formed when the metals are heated
with halogen
Ln
with carbon. They liberate hydrogen
heated with S

LnX 3
Ln2S3
from dilute acids and burn in halogens
to form halides. They form oxides M2O3
and
hydroxides
M(OH) 3.
The
hydroxides are definite compounds, not
just hydrated oxides. They are basic
like alkaline earth metal oxides and
LnN
LnC2
Ln(OH)3 + H2
hydroxides. Their general reactions are
depicted in Fig. 4.7.
Fig 4.7: Chemical reactions of the lanthanoids.
The best single use of the
lanthanoids is for the production of alloy steels for plates and pipes. A
well known alloy is mischmetall which consists of a lanthanoid metal
(~ 95%) and iron (~ 5%) and traces of S, C, Ca and Al. A good deal of
mischmetall is used in Mg-based alloy to produce bullets, shell and
lighter flint. Mixed oxides of lanthanoids are employed as catalysts in
petroleum cracking. Some individual Ln oxides are used as phosphors
in television screens and similar fluorescing surfaces.

111 The d- and f- Block Elements

Rationalised 2023-24

The actinoids are radioactive elements and the earlier members have
relatively long half-lives, the latter ones have half-life values ranging from
a day to 3 minutes for lawrencium (Z =103). The latter members could be
prepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study
more difficult.
4.6.1 Electronic
Configurations

All the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of 7s2
and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons
are formally added to 5f, though not in thorium (Z = 90) but from Pa
onwards the 5f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in
the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids
0
7
14
are related to the stabilities of the f , f and f occupancies of the 5f
orbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5f 77s2 and
7
1
2
[Rn] 5f 6d 7s . Although the 5f orbitals resemble the 4f orbitals in their
angular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4f orbitals
and hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.

4.6.2 Ionic Sizes

The general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well.
There is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M3+ ions across the
series. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction (like lanthanoid
contraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element
in this series resulting from poor shielding by 5f electrons.

4.6.3 Oxidation
States

There is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to
the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The
known oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4.11.
The actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the
first half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example,
the maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7
respectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table
4.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds
in +3 state than in the +4 state. However, +3 and +4 ions tend to hydrolyse.
Because the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so
uneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory
to review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.

4.6.4 General
Characteristics
and Comparison
with Lanthanoids

The actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display
a variety of structures. The structural variability is obtained
due to irregularities in metallic radii which are far greater
than in lanthanoids.

Chemistry 112

The actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided.
The action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide
and hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at
moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are
slightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide
layers; alkalies have no action.
The magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those
of the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility
of the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 f electrons is roughly
parallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have
higher values.
It is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation
enthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are
lower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to
be expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will
penetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore,
be more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f electrons
of the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less
firmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids.
A comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to
different characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar
to that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the
actinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids
in showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in
properties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid
and actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and
therefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their
respective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because
the chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known
at the present time.

to exhibit +4 oxidation state.

4.7 Some
Applications
of d- and
f-Block
Elements

Iron and steels are the most important construction materials. Their
production is based on the reduction of iron oxides, the removal of
impurities and the addition of carbon and alloying metals such as Cr, Mn
and Ni. Some compounds are manufactured for special purposes such as
TiO for the pigment industry and MnO2 for use in dry battery cells. The
battery industry also requires Zn and Ni/Cd. The elements of Group 11
are still worthy of being called the coinage metals, although Ag and Au

are restricted to collection items and the contemporary UK ‘copper’ coins
are copper-coated steel. The ‘silver’ UK coins are a Cu/Ni alloy. Many of
the metals and/or their compounds are essential catalysts in the chemical
industry. V2O5 catalyses the oxidation of SO2 in the manufacture of
sulphuric acid. TiCl4 with A1(CH3)3 forms the basis of the Ziegler catalysts
used to manufacture polyethylene (polythene). Iron catalysts are used in
the Haber process for the production of ammonia from N2/H2 mixtures.
Nickel catalysts enable the hydrogenation of fats to proceed. In the Wacker
process the oxidation of ethyne to ethanal is catalysed by PdCl2. Nickel
complexes are useful in the polymerisation of alkynes and other organic
compounds such as benzene. The photographic industry relies on the
special light-sensitive properties of AgBr.

Summary
The d-block consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic
table. In these elements the inner d orbitals are progressively filled. The f-block is placed
outside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block, 4f and
5f orbitals are progressively filled.
Corresponding to the filling of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, three series of transition
elements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties
such as –high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity
and metallic character. Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed
to the involvement of (n –1) d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In
many of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which
indicates that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly a favourable configuration
for strong interatomic interaction.
Successive ionisation enthalpies do not increase as steeply as in the main group
elements with increasing atomic number. Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons
from (n –1) d orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of (n –1) d electrons
in the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these
elements. Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic
behaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial
compounds and complexes.
The transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are
sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are ‘noble’. Of the
first series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive.
The transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen,
sulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides
are generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These
oxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometallic salts. Potassium dichromate and
potassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from
the chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract.
Pyrolusite ore (MnO2) is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the
dichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents.
The two series of inner transition elements, lanthanoids and actinoids constitute
the f-block of the periodic table. With the successive filling of the inner orbitals, 4f, there
is a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series
(lanthanoid contraction). This has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the
elements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white
metals. They react easily with water to give solutions giving +3 ions. The principal
oxidation state is +3, although +4 and +2 oxidation states are also exhibited by some

Rationalised 2023-24

occasionally. The chemistry of the actinoids is more complex in view of their ability to
exist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive
which make the study of these elements rather difficult.
There are many useful applications of the d- and f-block elements and their
compounds, notable among them being in varieties of steels, catalysts, complexes,
organic syntheses, etc.

5.1 Werner’
Werner’ss
Theory of
Coordination
Compounds

Coordination
Compounds
Coordination Compounds are the backbone of modern inorganic
and bio–inorganic chemistry and chemical industry.

In the previous Unit we learnt that the transition metals
form a large number of complex compounds in which
the metal atoms are bound to a number of anions or
neutral molecules by sharing of electrons. In modern
terminology such compounds are called coordination
compounds. The chemistry of coordination compounds
is an important and challenging area of modern
inorganic chemistry. New concepts of chemical bonding
and molecular structure have provided insights into
the functioning of these compounds as vital components
of biological systems. Chlorophyll, haemoglobin and
vitamin B12 are coordination compounds of magnesium,
iron and cobalt respectively. Variety of metallurgical
processes, industrial catalysts and analytical reagents
involve the use of coordination compounds.
Coordination compounds also find many applications
in electroplating, textile dyeing and medicinal chemistry.

Alfred Werner (1866-1919), a Swiss chemist was the first to formulate
his ideas about the structures of coordination compounds. He prepared
and characterised a large number of coordination compounds and
studied their physical and chemical behaviour by simple experimental
techniques. Werner proposed the concept of a primary valence and
a secondary valence for a metal ion. Binary compounds such as
CrCl3, CoCl2 or PdCl2 have primary valence of 3, 2 and 2 respectively.
In a series of compounds of cobalt(III) chloride with ammonia, it was
found that some of the chloride ions could be precipitated as AgCl on
adding excess silver nitrate solution in cold but some remained in

These observations, together with the results of conductivity
measurements in solution can be explained if (i) six groups in all,
either chloride ions or ammonia molecules or both, remain bonded to
the cobalt ion during the reaction and (ii) the compounds are formulated
as shown in Table 5.1, where the atoms within the square brackets
form a single entity which does not dissociate under the reaction
conditions. Werner proposed the term secondary valence for the
number of groups bound directly to the metal ion; in each of these
examples the secondary valences are six.

Note that the last two compounds in Table 5.1 have identical empirical
formula, CoCl3.4NH3, but distinct properties. Such compounds are
termed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of
coordination compounds. The main postulates are:
1. In coordination compounds metals show two types of linkages
(valences)-primary and secondary.
2. The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by
negative ions.
3. The secondary valences are non ionisable. These are satisfied by
neutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to
the coordination number and is fixed for a metal.
4. The ions/groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have
characteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different
coordination numbers.
In modern formulations, such spatial arrangements are called
coordination polyhedra. The species within the square bracket are
coordination entities or complexes and the ions outside the square
bracket are called counter ions.
He further postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar
geometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of
3+
2+
+
transition metals. Thus, [Co(NH3)6] , [CoCl(NH3)5] and [CoCl2(NH3)4]
2–
are octahedral entities, while [Ni(CO)4] and [PtCl4] are tetrahedral and
square planar, respectively.

Difference between a double salt and a complex

Both double salts as well as complexes are formed by the combination
of two or more stable compounds in stoichiometric ratio. However, they
differ in the fact that double salts such as carnallite, KCl.MgCl2.6H2O,
Mohr’s salt, FeSO4.(NH4)2SO4.6H2O, potash alum, KAl(SO4)2.12H2O, etc.
dissociate into simple ions completely when dissolved in water. However,
4–
complex ions such as [Fe(CN)6] of K4 [Fe(CN)6] do not dissociate into
2+
–
Fe and CN ions.

Werner was born on December 12, 1866, in Mülhouse,
a small community in the French province of Alsace.
His study of chemistry began in Karlsruhe (Germany)
and continued in Zurich (Switzerland), where in his
doctoral thesis in 1890, he explained the difference in
properties of certain nitrogen containing organic
(1866-1919)
substances on the basis of isomerism. He extended vant
Hoff’s theory of tetrahedral carbon atom and modified
it for nitrogen. Werner showed optical and electrical differences between
complex compounds based on physical measurements. In fact, Werner was
the first to discover optical activity in certain coordination compounds.
He, at the age of 29 years became a full professor at Technische
Hochschule in Zurich in 1895. Alfred Werner was a chemist and educationist.
His accomplishments included the development of the theory of coordination
compounds. This theory, in which Werner proposed revolutionary ideas about
how atoms and molecules are linked together, was formulated in a span of
only three years, from 1890 to 1893. The remainder of his career was spent
gathering the experimental support required to validate his new ideas. Werner
became the first Swiss chemist to win the Nobel Prize in 1913 for his work
on the linkage of atoms and the coordination theory.

5.2 Definitions of
Some
Important
Terms
Pertaining to
Coordination
Compounds

( a ) Coordination entity

A coordination entity constitutes a central metal atom or ion bonded
to a fixed number of ions or molecules. For example, [CoCl3(NH3)3]
is a coordination entity in which the cobalt ion is surrounded by
three ammonia molecules and three chloride ions. Other examples
4–
3+
are [Ni(CO)4], [PtCl2(NH3)2], [Fe(CN)6] , [Co(NH3)6] .
(b) Central atom/ion

In a coordination entity, the atom/ion to which a fixed number
of ions/groups are bound in a definite geometrical arrangement
around it, is called the central atom or ion. For example, the
central atom/ion in the coordination entities: [NiCl 2(H 2O) 4],
2+
3–
2+
3+
3+
[CoCl(NH3) 5] and [Fe(CN)6] are Ni , Co and Fe , respectively.
These central atoms/ions are also referred to as Lewis acids.
( c ) Ligands

The ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the
coordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions
–
such as Cl , small molecules such as H2O or NH3, larger molecules
such as H2NCH2CH2NH2 or N(CH2CH2NH2)3 or even macromolecules,
such as proteins.
When a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor
–
atom, as with Cl , H2O or NH3, the ligand is said to be unidentate.
When a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in
H2NCH2CH2NH2 (ethane-1,2-diamine) or C2O42– (oxalate), the
ligand is said to be didentate and when several donor atoms are
present in a single ligand as in N(CH2CH2NH2)3, the ligand is said
to be polydentate. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA4–) is
an important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two
nitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion.
When a di- or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor
atoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a
chelate ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the
denticity of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes
tend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate
ligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of
the two ligetes in the complex is called ambidentate
ligand. Examples of such ligands are the NO2– and
–
–
SCN ions. NO2 ion can coordinate either through
nitrogen or through oxygen to a central metal
atom/ion.
Similarly, SCN– ion can coordinate through the
sulphur or nitrogen atom.
( d ) Coordination

number

The coordination number (CN) of a metal ion in a complex can be
defined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is
2–
directly bonded. For example, in the complex ions, [PtCl6] and
2+
[Ni(NH3)4] , the coordination number of Pt and Ni are 6 and 4
3–
respectively. Similarly, in the complex ions, [Fe(C2O4)3] and
3+
[Co(en)3] , the coordination number of both, Fe and Co, is 6 because
C2O42– and en (ethane-1,2-diamine) are didentate ligands.

It is important to note here that coordination number of the central
atom/ion is determined only by the number of sigma bonds formed by
the ligand with the central atom/ion. Pi bonds, if formed between the
ligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose.
(e) Coordination sphere

The central atom/ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in
square bracket and is collectively termed as the coordination
sphere. The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and
are called counter ions. For example, in the complex K4[Fe(CN)6],
the coordination sphere is [Fe(CN)6]4– and the counter ion is K+.
( f ) Coordination polyhedron

The spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly
attached to the central atom/ion defines a coordination
polyhedron about the central atom. The most common
coordination polyhedra are octahedral, square planar and
3+
tetrahedral. For example, [Co(NH3)6] is octahedral, [Ni(CO) 4] is
2–
tetrahedral and [PtCl4] is square planar. Fig. 5.1 shows the
shapes of different coordination polyhedra.

Fig. 5.1: Shapes of different coordination polyhedra. M
represents the central atom/ion and L, a unidentate
ligand.
(g) Oxidation number of central atom

The oxidation number of the central atom in a complex is defined
as the charge it would carry if all the ligands are removed along
with the electron pairs that are shared with the central atom. The
oxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis
following the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation
3–
number of copper in [Cu(CN)4] is +1 and it is written as Cu(I).
( h ) Homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes

Complexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor
3+
groups, e.g., [Co(NH3)6] , are known as homoleptic. Complexes in
which a metal is bound to more than one kind of donor groups,
+
e.g., [Co(NH3)4Cl2] , are known as heteroleptic.

5 . 3 Nomenclature
of
Coordination
Compounds

Nomenclature is important in Coordination Chemistry because of the
need to have an unambiguous method of describing formulas and
writing systematic names, particularly when dealing with isomers. The
formulas and names adopted for coordination entities are based on the
recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry (IUPAC).

5.3.1 Formulas of
Mononuclear
Coordination
Entities

Note: The 2004 IUPAC
draft recommends that
ligands will be sorted
alphabetically,
irrespective of charge.

5.3.2 Naming of
Mononuclear
Coordination
Compounds

Note: The 2004
IUPAC draft
recommends that
anionic ligands will
end with–ido so that
chloro would become
chlorido, etc.

The formula of a compound is a shorthand tool used to provide basic
information about the constitution of the compound in a concise and
convenient manner. Mononuclear coordination entities contain a single
central metal atom. The following rules are applied while writing the formulas:
(i) The central atom is listed first.
(ii) The ligands are then listed in alphabetical order. The placement of
a ligand in the list does not depend on its charge.
(iii) Polydentate ligands are also listed alphabetically. In case of
abbreviated ligand, the first letter of the abbreviation is used to
determine the position of the ligand in the alphabetical order.
(iv) The formula for the entire coordination entity, whether charged or
not, is enclosed in square brackets. When ligands are polyatomic,
their formulas are enclosed in parentheses. Ligand abbreviations
are also enclosed in parentheses.
(v) There should be no space between the ligands and the metal
within a coordination sphere.
(vi) When the formula of a charged coordination entity is to be written
without that of the counter ion, the charge is indicated outside the
square brackets as a right superscript with the number before the
3–
3+
sign. For example, [Co(CN)6] , [Cr(H2O)6] , etc.
(vii) The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the anion(s).
The names of coordination compounds are derived by following the
principles of additive nomenclature. Thus, the groups that surround the
central atom must be identified in the name. They are listed as prefixes
to the name of the central atom along with any appropriate multipliers.
The following rules are used when naming coordination compounds:
(i) The cation is named first in both positively and negatively charged
coordination entities.
(ii) The ligands are named in an alphabetical order before the name of the
central atom/ion. (This procedure is reversed from writing formula).
(iii) Names of the anionic ligands end in –o, those of neutral and cationic
ligands are the same except aqua for H2O, ammine for NH3, carbonyl
for CO and nitrosyl for NO. While writing the formula of coordination
entity, these are enclosed in brackets ( ).
(iv) Prefixes mono, di, tri, etc., are used to indicate the number of the
individual ligands in the coordination entity. When the names of
the ligands include a numerical prefix, then the terms, bis, tris,
tetrakis are used, the ligand to which they refer being placed in
parentheses. For example, [NiCl2(PPh3)2] is named as
dichloridobis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II).
(v) Oxidation state of the metal in cation, anion or neutral coordination
entity is indicated by Roman numeral in parenthesis.
(vi) If the complex ion is a cation, the metal is named same as the
element. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt and
Pt is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the name of
the metal ends with the suffix – ate. For example, Co in a complex
2
anion, Co  SCN 4  is called cobaltate. For some metals, the Latin
names are used in the complex anions, e.g., ferrate for Fe.

(vii) The neutral complex molecule is named similar to that of the
complex cation.
The following examples illustrate the nomenclature for coordination
compounds.
1. [Cr(NH3)3(H2O)3]Cl3 is named as:
triamminetriaquachromium(III) chloride
Explanation: The complex ion is inside the square bracket, which is
a cation. The amine ligands are named before the aqua ligands
according to alphabetical order. Since there are three chloride ions in
the compound, the charge on the complex ion must be +3 (since the
compound is electrically neutral). From the charge on the complex
ion and the charge on the ligands, we can calculate the oxidation
number of the metal. In this example, all the ligands are neutral
molecules. Therefore, the oxidation number of chromium must be
the same as the charge of the complex ion, +3.

Notice how the name
of the metal differs in
cation and anion even
though they contain the
same metal ions.

2. [Co(H2NCH2CH2NH2)3]2(SO4)3 is named as:
tris(ethane-1,2–diamine)cobalt(III) sulphate
Explanation: The sulphate is the counter anion in this molecule.
Since it takes 3 sulphates to bond with two complex cations, the
charge on each complex cation must be +3. Further, ethane-1,2–
diamine is a neutral molecule, so the oxidation number of cobalt
in the complex ion must be +3. Remember that you never have to
indicate the number of cations and anions in the name of an
ionic compound.
3. [Ag(NH3)2][Ag(CN)2] is named as:
diamminesilver(I) dicyanidoargentate(I)

(a) Tetraammineaquachloridocobalt(III) chloride

5 . 4 Isomerism in
Coordination
Compounds

Isomers are two or more compounds that have the same chemical
formula but a different arrangement of atoms. Because of the different
arrangement of atoms, they differ in one or more physical or chemical
properties. Two principal types of isomerism are known among
coordination compounds. Each of which can be further subdivided.
(a) Stereoisomerism

(i) Geometrical isomerism

(ii) Optical isomerism

( b ) Structural isomerism

(i) Linkage isomerism
(ii) Coordination isomerism
(iii) Ionisation isomerism
(iv) Solvate isomerism
Stereoisomers have the same chemical formula and chemical
bonds but they have different spatial arrangement. Structural isomers
have different bonds. A detailed account of these isomers are
given below.
This type of isomerism arises in heteroleptic
complexes due to different possible geometric
arrangements of the ligands. Important examples
of this behaviour are found with coordination
numbers 4 and 6. In a square planar complex of
formula [MX2L2] (X and L are unidentate), the
two ligands X may be arranged adjacent to each
other in a cis isomer, or opposite to each other
in a trans isomer as depicted in Fig. 5.2.

Other square planar complex of the type
MABXL (where A, B, X, L are unidentates)
shows three isomers-two cis and one trans.
You may attempt to draw these structures.
Such isomerism is not possible for a tetrahedral
geometry but similar behaviour is possible in
octahedral complexes of formula [MX2L4] in
which the two ligands X may be oriented cis or
trans to each other (Fig. 5.3).

of [CoCl 2(en)2 ]

Fig. 5.5
The facial (fac) and
meridional (mer)
isomers of
[Co(NH3 )3(NO2 ) 3]

This type of isomerism also
arises when didentate ligands
L – L [e.g., NH2 CH2 CH2 NH2 (en)]
are present in complexes of formula
[MX2(L – L)2] (Fig. 5.4).
Another type of geometrical
isomerism occurs in octahedral
coordination entities of the type
[Ma3b 3] like [Co(NH 3) 3(NO 2) 3]. If
three donor atoms of the same
ligands occupy adjacent positions
at the corners of an octahedral
face, we have the facial (fac)
isomer. When the positions are
around the meridian of the
octahedron, we get the meridional
(mer) isomer (Fig. 5.5).

Why is geometrical isomerism not possible in tetrahedral complexes
having two different types of unidentate ligands coordinated with
the central metal ion ?

Example 5.4

Tetrahedral complexes do not show geometrical isomerism because
the relative positions of the unidentate ligands attached to the central
metal atom are the same with respect to each other.

Solution

5.4.2

Optical Isomerism

Fig.5.6: Optical isomers (d and l) of [Co(en)3 ] 3+

Optical isomers are mirror images that
cannot be superimposed on one
another. These are called as
enantiomers. The molecules or ions
that cannot be superimposed are
called chiral. The two forms are called
dextro (d) and laevo (l) depending
upon the direction they rotate the
plane of polarised light in a
polarimeter (d rotates to the right, l to
the left). Optical isomerism is common
in octahedral complexes involving
didentate ligands (Fig. 5.6).
In a coordination
entity of the type
2+
[PtCl2(en) 2] , only the
cis-isomer shows optical
activity (Fig. 5.7).

5.4.3 Linkage
Isomerism

Linkage isomerism arises in a coordination compound containing
ambidentate ligand. A simple example is provided by complexes
–
containing the thiocyanate ligand, NCS , which may bind through the
nitrogen to give M–NCS or through sulphur to give M–SCN. Jørgensen
discovered such behaviour in the complex [Co(NH3)5(NO2)]Cl2, which is
obtained as the red form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through
oxygen (–ONO), and as the yellow form, in which the nitrite ligand is
bound through nitrogen (–NO2).

5.4.4 Coordination
Isomerism

This type of isomerism arises from the interchange of ligands between
cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in a complex.
An example is provided by [Co(NH3)6][Cr(CN)6], in which the NH3 ligands
3+
–
3+
are bound to Co and the CN ligands to Cr . In its coordination
3+
isomer [Cr(NH3)6][Co(CN)6], the NH3 ligands are bound to Cr and the
–
3+
CN ligands to Co .

5.4.5 Ionisation
Isomerism

This form of isomerism arises when the counter ion in a complex salt
is itself a potential ligand and can displace a ligand which can then
become the counter ion. An example is provided by the ionisation
isomers [Co(NH3)5(SO4)]Br and [Co(NH3)5Br]SO4.

5.4.6 Solvate
Isomerism

This form of isomerism is known as ‘hydrate isomerism’ in case where
water is involved as a solvent. This is similar to ionisation isomerism.
Solvate isomers differ by whether or not a solvent molecule is directly
bonded to the metal ion or merely present as free solvent moleculesin
the crystal lattice. An example is provided by the aqua
complex [Cr(H2O)6]Cl3 (violet) and its solvate isomer [Cr(H2O)5Cl]Cl2.H2O
(grey-green).

5 . 5 Bonding in
Coordination
Compounds

Werner was the first to describe the bonding features in coordination
compounds. But his theory could not answer basic questions like:
(i) Why only certain elements possess the remarkable property of
forming coordination compounds?
(ii) Why the bonds in coordination compounds have directional
properties?
(iii) Why coordination compounds have characteristic magnetic and
optical properties?
Many approaches have been put forth to explain the nature of
bonding in coordination compounds viz. Valence Bond Theory (VBT),
Crystal Field Theory (CFT), Ligand Field Theory (LFT) and Molecular
Orbital Theory (MOT). We shall focus our attention on elementary
treatment of the application of VBT and CFT to coordination compounds.

5.5.1 Valence
Bond
Theory

According to this theory, the metal atom or ion under the influence of
ligands can use its (n-1)d, ns, np or ns, np, nd orbitals for hybridisation
to yield a set of equivalent orbitals of definite geometry such as octahedral,
tetrahedral, square planar and so on (Table 5.2). These hybridised orbitals
are allowed to overlap with ligand orbitals that can donate electron pairs
for bonding. This is illustrated by the following examples.

It is usually possible to predict the geometry of a complex from
the knowledge of its
magnetic behaviour on
the basis of the valence
bond theory.
In the diamagnetic
octahedral
complex,
3+
[Co(NH3)6] , the cobalt ion
is in +3 oxidation state
and has the electronic
6
configuration 3d . The
hybridisation scheme is as
shown in diagram.
Six pairs of electrons, one from each NH3 molecule, occupy the six
hybrid orbitals. Thus, the complex has octahedral geometry and is
diamagnetic because of the absence of unpaired electron. In the formation
of this complex, since the inner d orbital (3d) is used in hybridisation,
3+
the complex, [Co(NH3)6] is called an inner orbital or low spin or spin
3–
paired complex. The paramagnetic octahedral complex, [CoF6] uses
3 2
outer orbital (4d ) in hybridisation (sp d ). It is thus called outer orbital
or high spin or spin free complex. Thus:

Properties
of
Coordination
Compounds

The magnetic moment of coordination compounds can be measured
by the magnetic susceptibility experiments. The results can be used to
obtain information about the number of unpaired electrons and hence
structures adopted by metal complexes.
A critical study of the magnetic data of coordination compounds of
metals of the first transition series reveals some complications. For
3+

3+
metal ions with upto three electrons in the d orbitals, like Ti (d ); V
2
3+
3
(d ); Cr (d ); two vacant d orbitals are available for octahedral
hybridisation with 4s and 4p orbitals. The magnetic behaviour of these
free ions and their coordination entities is similar. When more than
three 3d electrons are present, the required pair of 3d orbitals for
octahedral hybridisation is not directly available (as a consequence of
4
2+

Hund’s rule). Thus, for d (Cr , Mn ), d (Mn , Fe ), d (Fe , Co )
cases, a vacant pair of d orbitals results only by pairing of 3d electrons
which leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively.
The magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases,
6
especially with coordination compounds containing d ions. However,
with species containing d4 and d5 ions there are complications. [Mn(CN)6]3–

has magnetic moment of two unpaired electrons while [MnCl6] has a

paramagnetic moment of four unpaired electrons. [Fe(CN)6] has magnetic

moment of five unpaired electrons. [CoF6] is paramagnetic with four
3–
unpaired electrons while [Co(C2O4)3] is diamagnetic. This apparent
anomaly is explained by valence bond theory in terms of formation of

5.5.3 Limitations
of Valence
Bond
Theory

While the VB theory, to a larger extent, explains the formation, structures
and magnetic behaviour of coordination compounds, it suffers from
the following shortcomings:
(i) It involves a number of assumptions.
(ii) It does not give quantitative interpretation of magnetic data.
(iii) It does not explain the colour exhibited by coordination compounds.
(iv) It does not give a quantitative interpretation of the thermodynamic
or kinetic stabilities of coordination compounds.
(v) It does not make exact predictions regarding the tetrahedral and
square planar structures of 4-coordinate complexes.
(vi) It does not distinguish between weak and strong ligands.

5.5.4 Crystal
Field
Theory

The crystal field theory (CFT) is an electrostatic model which considers
the metal-ligand bond to be ionic arising purely from electrostatic
interactions between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands are treated
as point charges in case of anions or point dipoles in case of neutral
molecules. The five d orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion
have same energy, i.e., they are degenerate. This degeneracy is
maintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges
surrounds the metal atom/ion. However, when this negative field is
due to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules
like NH3 and H2O) in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the
degeneracy of the d orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the d
orbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal
field. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields.
( a ) Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities

In an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding
the metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in
metal d orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands.
Such a repulsion is more when the metal d orbital is directed towards
the ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the d x 2  y 2
and d z2 orbitals which point towards the axes along the direction of
the ligand will experience more repulsion and will be raised in
energy; and the dxy, dyz and dxz orbitals which are directed between
the axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in
the spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the d orbitals
has been removed due to ligand electron-metal electron repulsions
in the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy, t2g
set and two orbitals of higher energy, eg set. This splitting of the

degenerate levels due to the
presence of ligands in a
definite geometry is termed as
crystal field splitting and
the energy separation is
denoted by Do (the subscript
o is for octahedral) (Fig.5.8).
Thus, the energy of the two eg
orbitals will increase by (3/5)
Do and that of the three t2g will
decrease by (2/5)Do.
The crystal field splitting,
Do, depends upon the field
produced by the ligand and
charge on the metal ion. Some
ligands are able to produce
strong fields in which case, the
splitting will be large whereas
others produce weak fields
Fig.5.8: d orbital splitting in an octahedral crystal field
and consequently result in
small splitting of d orbitals.
In general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing
field strength as given below:
–
–
–
–
2–
–
–
2–
–
I < Br < SCN < Cl < S < F < OH < C2O4 < H2O < NCS
< edta4– < NH3 < en < CN – < CO
Such a series is termed as spectrochemical series. It is an
experimentally determined series based on the absorption of light
by complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the d
orbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously,
the single d electron occupies one of the lower energy t2g orbitals. In
2
3
d and d coordination entities, the d electrons occupy the t2g orbitals
4
singly in accordance with the Hund’s rule. For d ions, two possible
patterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could
either enter the t2g level and pair with an existing electron, or (ii) it
could avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the
eg level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative
magnitude of the crystal field splitting, Do and the pairing energy, P
(P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single
orbital). The two options are:
(i) If Do < P, the fourth electron enters one of the eg orbitals giving the
3 1
configuration t 2g e g . Ligands for which Do < P are known as weak
field ligands and form high spin complexes.
(ii) If Do > P, it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth
4 0
electron to occupy a t2g orbital with configuration t2g eg . Ligands
which produce this effect are known as strong field ligands and
form low spin complexes.
4
7
Calculations show that d to d coordination entities are more
stable for strong field as compared to weak field cases.

( b ) Crystal field splitting in tetrahedral coordination entities

Fig.5.9: d orbital splitting in a tetrahedral
crystal field.

5.5.5 Colour in
Coordination
Compounds

In tetrahedral coordination entity formation,
the d orbital splitting (Fig. 5.9) is inverted
and is smaller as compared to the octahedral
field splitting. For the same metal, the same
ligands and metal-ligand distances, it can
be shown that Dt = (4/9) D0. Consequently,
the orbital splitting energies are not
sufficiently large for forcing pairing and,
therefore, low spin configurations are rarely
observed. The ‘g’ subscript is used for the
octahedral and square planar complexes
which have centre of symmetry. Since
tetrahedral complexes lack symmetry, ‘g’
subscript is not used with energy levels.

In the previous Unit, we learnt that one of the most distinctive
properties of transition metal complexes is their wide range of colours.
This means that some of the visible spectrum is being removed from
white light as it passes through the sample, so the light that emerges
is no longer white. The colour of the complex is complementary to
that which is absorbed. The complementary colour is the colour
generated from the wavelength left over; if green light is absorbed by
the complex, it appears red. Table 5.3 gives the relationship of the
different wavelength absorbed and the colour observed.

The colour in the coordination compounds can be readily explained
in terms of the crystal field theory. Consider, for example, the complex
[Ti(H2O)6]3+, which is violet in colour. This is an octahedral complex
3+
1
where the single electron (Ti is a 3d system) in the metal d orbital is
in the t2g level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state
available for the electron is the empty eg level. If light corresponding to
the energy of blue-green region is absorbed by the complex, it would
1

excite the electron from t2g level to the eg level (t2g eg ® t2g eg ).
Consequently, the complex appears violet in colour (Fig. 5.10). The
crystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds
to d-d transition of the electron.

The crystal field model is successful in explaining the formation,
structures, colour and magnetic properties of coordination compounds
to a large extent. However, from the assumptions that the ligands are
point charges, it follows that anionic ligands should exert the greatest
splitting effect. The anionic ligands actually are found at the low end
of the spectrochemical series. Further, it does not take into account
the covalent character of bonding between the ligand and the central
atom. These are some of the weaknesses of CFT, which are explained
by ligand field theory (LFT) and molecular orbital theory which are
beyond the scope of the present study.

The metal-carbon bond in metal carbonyls
possess both s and p character. The M–C s bond
is formed by the donation of lone pair of electrons
on the carbonyl carbon into a vacant orbital of
the metal. The M–C p bond is formed by the
donation of a pair of electrons from a filled d orbital
of metal into the vacant antibonding p* orbital of
carbon monoxide. The metal to ligand bonding
creates a synergic effect which strengthens the
bond between CO and the metal (Fig.5.14).

The coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds
are widely present in the mineral, plant and animal worlds and are
known to play many important functions in the area of analytical
chemistry, metallurgy, biological systems, industry and medicine. These
are described below:
• Coordination compounds find use in many qualitative and
quantitative chemical analysis. The familiar colour reactions given
by metal ions with a number of ligands (especially chelating ligands),
as a result of formation of coordination entities, form the basis for
their detection and estimation by classical and instrumental methods
of analysis. Examples of such reagents include EDTA, DMG
(dimethylglyoxime), a–nitroso–b–naphthol, cupron, etc.
• Hardness of water is estimated by simple titration with Na2EDTA.
2+
2+
The Ca and Mg ions form stable complexes with EDTA. The
selective estimation of these ions can be done due to difference in
the stability constants of calcium and magnesium complexes.
• Some important extraction processes of metals, like those of silver and
gold, make use of complex formation. Gold, for example, combines with
cyanide in the presence of oxygen and water to form the coordination
–
entity [Au(CN)2] in aqueous solution. Gold can be separated in metallic
form from this solution by the addition of zinc.
• Similarly, purification of metals can be achieved through formation
and subsequent decomposition of their coordination compounds.

Coordination compounds are of great importance in biological
systems. The pigment responsible for photosynthesis, chlorophyll,
is a coordination compound of magnesium. Haemoglobin, the red
pigment of blood which acts as oxygen carrier is a coordination
compound of iron. Vitamin B12, cyanocobalamine, the anti–
pernicious anaemia factor, is a coordination compound of cobalt.
Among the other compounds of biological importance with
coordinated metal ions are the enzymes like, carboxypeptidase A
and carbonic anhydrase (catalysts of biological systems).
Coordination compounds are used as catalysts for many industrial
processes. Examples include rhodium complex, [(Ph3P)3RhCl], a
Wilkinson catalyst, is used for the hydrogenation of alkenes.
Articles can be electroplated with silver and gold much more

In black and white photography, the developed film is fixed by
washing with hypo solution which dissolves the undecomposed

There is growing interest in the use of chelate therapy in medicinal
chemistry. An example is the treatment of problems caused by the
presence of metals in toxic proportions in plant/animal systems.
Thus, excess of copper and iron are removed by the chelating ligands
D–penicillamine and desferrioxime B via the formation of coordination
compounds. EDTA is used in the treatment of lead poisoning. Some
coordination compounds of platinum effectively inhibit the growth
of tumours. Examples are: cis–platin and related compounds.

Summary
The chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging
area of modern inorganic chemistry. During the last fifty years, advances in this
area, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and
molecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry and vital
insights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems.
The first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure
and bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. Werner. His theory
postulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary) by a
metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry
these linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent)
bonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism, Werner predicted the
geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities.
The Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains with reasonable success, the
formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds.
It, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour
and has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds.
The Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to coordination compounds is based on
the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges),
137

on the degeneracy of d orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. The
splitting of the d orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong
and weak crystal fields. The treatment provides for quantitative estimations of
orbital separation energies, magnetic moments and spectral and stability
parameters. However, the assumption that ligands consititute point charges
creates many theoretical difficulties.
The metal–carbon bond in metal carbonyls possesses both s and p character.
The ligand to metal is s bond and metal to ligand is p bond. This unique synergic
bonding provides stability to metal carbonyls.
Coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds provide
critical insights into the functioning and structures of vital components of
biological systems. Coordination compounds also find extensive applications in
metallurgical processes, analytical and medicinal chemistry.

5.6 In Ni(CO)4, Ni is in zero oxidation state whereas in NiCl4 , it is in +2 oxidation
state. In the presence of CO ligand, the unpaired d electrons of Ni pair up but
–
Cl being a weak ligand is unable to pair up the unpaired electrons.
–

5.7 In presence of CN , (a strong ligand) the 3d electrons pair up leaving only one
unpaired electron. The hybridisation is d2sp3 forming inner orbital complex. In
the presence of H 2O, (a weak ligand), 3d electrons do not pair up. The
hybridisation is sp3d2 forming an outer orbital complex containing five unpaired
electrons, it is strongly paramagnetic.
5.8 In the presence of NH3, the 3d electrons pair up leaving two d orbitals empty
to be involved in d2sp3 hybridisation forming inner orbital complex in case of [Co(NH3)6]3+.
In Ni(NH3)62+, Ni is in +2 oxidation state and has d 8 configuration, the
3 2
hybridisation involved is sp d forming outer orbital complex.
2

5.9 For square planar shape, the hybridisation is dsp . Hence the unpaired electrons
in 5d orbital pair up to make one d orbital empty for dsp2 hybridisation. Thus
there is no unpaired electron.

APPENDIX IV

Logarithms

Sometimes, a numerical expression may involve multiplication, division or rational powers of large
numbers. For such calculations, logarithms are very useful. They help us in making difficult calculations
easy. In Chemistry, logarithm values are required in solving problems of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics,
electrochemistry, etc. We shall first introduce this concept, and discuss the laws, which will have to be
followed in working with logarithms, and then apply this technique to a number of problems to show
how it makes difficult calculations simple.
We know that
23 = 8, 32 = 9, 53 = 125, 70 = 1
In general, for a positive real number a, and a rational number m, let am = b,
where b is a real number. In other words
the mth power of base a is b.
Another way of stating the same fact is
logarithm of b to base a is m.
If for a positive real number a, a ¹ 1
am = b,
we say that m is the logarithm of b to the base a.
b

We write this as lo g a  m ,
“log” being the abbreviation of the word “logarithm”.
Thus, we have
log 2 8 = 3,

Since 2

log 3 9 = 2,

Since 3

log 5 125 = 3,

Since 5

log 7 1 = 0,

Since 7

=8
= 9
= 125
=1

Laws of Logarithms
In the following discussion, we shall take logarithms to any base a, (a > 0 and a ¹ 1)
First Law: loga (mn) = logam + logan
Proof: Suppose that logam = x and logan = y
Then ax= m, ay = n
Hence mn = ax.ay = ax+y
It now follows from the definition of logarithms that
loga (mn) = x + y = loga m – loga n

m
 = loga m – logan
n

Second Law: loga 

Proof: Let logam = x, logan = y

Then ax = m, ay = n
Hence

n

a

a

xy

Therefore

m
  x  y  log a m  log a n
n

log a 

Third Law : loga(mn) = n logam
Proof : As before, if logam = x, then ax = m
Then

m

n

  a

 a

x n

nx

giving loga(mn) = nx = n loga m
Thus according to First Law: “the log of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of their logs.
Similarly, the Second Law says: the log of the ratio of two numbers is the difference of their logs. Thus,
the use of these laws converts a problem of multiplication/division into a problem of addition/subtraction,
which are far easier to perform than multiplication/division. That is why logarithms are so useful in
all numerical computations.
Logarithms to Base 10
Because number 10 is the base of writing numbers, it is very convenient to use logarithms to the base
10. Some examples are:
log10 10 = 1,
since 101 = 10
log10 100 = 2,
since 102 = 100
log10 10000 = 4,
since 104 = 10000
log10 0.01 = –2,
since 10–2 = 0.01
log10 0.001 = –3,
since 10–3 = 0.001
and log101 = 0
since 100 = 1
The above results indicate that if n is an integral power of 10, i.e., 1 followed by several zeros or
1 preceded by several zeros immediately to the right of the decimal point, then log n can be easily found.
If n is not an integral power of 10, then it is not easy to calculate log n. But mathematicians have
made tables from which we can read off approximate value of the logarithm of any positive number
between 1 and 10. And these are sufficient for us to calculate the logarithm of any number expressed
in decimal form. For this purpose, we always express the given decimal as the product of an integral
power of 10 and a number between 1 and 10.
Standard Form of Decimal
We can express any number in decimal form, as the product of (i) an integral power of 10, and (ii)
a number between 1 and 10. Here are some examples:
(i) 25.2 lies between 10 and 100
25.2

25.2 =

1

 10  2.52  10

10

(ii) 1038.4 lies between 1000 and 10000.
 1 0 3 8 .4 

1 0 3 8 .4

 10

3

 1 .0 3 8 4  1 0

3

1000

(iii) 0.005 lies between 0.001 and 0.01
∴ 0.005 = (0.005 × 1000) × 10–3 = 5.0 × 10–3
(iv) 0.00025 lies between 0.0001 and 0.001
∴ 0.00025 = (0.00025 × 10000) × 10–4 = 2.5 × 10–4

In each case, we divide or multiply the decimal by a power of 10, to bring one non-zero digit to the left
of the decimal point, and do the reverse operation by the same power of 10, indicated separately.
Thus, any positive decimal can be written in the form
p
n = m × 10
where p is an integer (positive, zero or negative) and 1< m < 10. This is called the “standard form of n.”
Working Rule
1. Move the decimal point to the left, or to the right, as may be necessary, to bring one non-zero digit
to the left of decimal point.
p
2. (i) If you move p places to the left, multiply by 10 .
(ii) If you move p places to the right, multiply by 10–p.
(iii) If you do not move the decimal point at all, multiply by 100.
(iv) Write the new decimal obtained by the power of 10 (of step 2) to obtain the standard form of
the given decimal.
Characteristic and Mantissa
Consider the standard form of n
n = m ×10p, where 1 < m < 10
Taking logarithms to the base 10 and using the laws of logarithms
log n = log m + log 10p
= log m + p log 10
= p + log m
Here p is an integer and as 1 < m < 10, so 0 < log m < 1, i.e., m lies between 0 and 1. When log
n has been expressed as p + log m, where p is an integer and 0 log m < 1, we say that p is the
“characteristic” of log n and that log m is the “mantissa of log n. Note that characteristic is always an
integer – positive, negative or zero, and mantissa is never negative and is always less than 1. If we can
find the characteristics and the mantissa of log n, we have to just add them to get log n.
Thus to find log n, all we have to do is as follows:
1. Put n in the standard form, say
n = m × 10p, 1 < m <10
2. Read off the characteristic p of log n from this expression (exponent of 10).
3. Look up log m from tables, which is being explained below.
4. Write log n = p + log m
If the characteristic p of a number n is say, 2 and the mantissa is .4133, then we have log n = 2
+ .4133 which we can write as 2.4133. If, however, the characteristic p of a number m is say –2 and the
mantissa is .4123, then we have log m = –2 + .4123. We cannot write this as –2.4123. (Why?) In order
to avoid this confusion we write 2 for –2 and thus we write log m = 2.4123 .
Now let us explain how to use the table of logarithms to find mantissas. A table is appended at the
end of this Appendix.
Observe that in the table, every row starts with a two digit number, 10, 11, 12,... 97, 98, 99. Every
column is headed by a one-digit number, 0, 1, 2, ...9. On the right, we have the section called “Mean
differences” which has 9 columns headed by 1, 2...9.

Now suppose we wish to find log (6.234). Then look into the row starting with 62. In this row, look
at the number in the column headed by 3. The number is 7945. This means that
log (6.230) = 0.7945*
But we want log (6.234). So our answer will be a little more than 0.7945. How much more? We look
this up in the section on Mean differences. Since our fourth digit is 4, look under the column headed
by 4 in the Mean difference section (in the row 62). We see the number 3 there. So add 3 to 7945. We
get 7948. So we finally have
log (6.234) = 0.7948.
Take another example. To find log (8.127), we look in the row 81 under column 2, and we find 9096.
We continue in the same row and see that the mean difference under 7 is 4. Adding this to 9096, and
we get 9100. So, log (8.127) = 0.9100.
Finding N when log N is given
We have so far discussed the procedure for finding log n when a positive number n given. We now turn
to its converse i.e., to find n when log n is given and give a method for this purpose. If log n = t, we
sometimes say n = antilog t. Therefore our task is given t, find its antilog. For this, we use the readymade antilog tables.
Suppose log n = 2.5372.
To find n, first take just the mantissa of log n. In this case it is .5372. (Make sure it is positive.)
Now take up antilog of this number in the antilog table which is to be used exactly like the log table.
In the antilog table, the entry under column 7 in the row .53 is 3443 and the mean difference for the
last digit 2 in that row is 2, so the table gives 3445. Hence,
antilog (.5372) = 3.445
Now since log n = 2.5372, the characteristic of log n is 2. So the standard form of n is given by
2
n = 3.445 × 10
or n = 344.5
Illustration 1:
If log x = 1.0712, find x.
Solution: We find that the number corresponding to 0712 is 1179. Since characteristic of log x is 1, we
have
x = 1.179 × 101
= 11.79
Illustration 2:
If log10 x = 2.1352, find x.
Solution: From antilog tables, we find that the number corresponding to 1352 is 1366. Since the
characteristic is 2 i.e., –2, so
x = 1.366 × 10–2 = 0.01366
Use of Logarithms in Numerical Calculations
Illustration 1:
Find 6.3 × 1.29
Solution: Let x = 6.3 × 1.29
Then log10 x = log (6.3 × 1.29) = log 6.3 + log 1.29
Now,
log 6.3 = 0.7993
log 1.29 = 0.1106
\ log10 x = 0.9099,

* It should, however, be noted that the values given in the table are not exact. They are only approximate values,
although we use the sign of equality which may give the impression that they are exact values. The same
convention will be followed in respect of antilogarithm of a number.

+3 is the common oxidation state of the lanthanoids
In addition to +3, oxidation states +2 and +4 are also exhibited by some of the lanthanoids.

4.13

In transition elements the oxidation states vary from +1 to any highest oxidation state by one
For example, for manganese it may vary as +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7. In the nontransition elements the
variation is selective, always differing by 2, e.g. +2, +4, or +3, +5 or +4, +6 etc.

4.18

Except Sc 3+, all others will be coloured in aqueous solution because of incompletely filled
3d-orbitals, will give rise to d-d transitions.

FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that children’s
life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks
a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our
system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi
and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement
this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance
of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of
education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to
pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,
time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the
information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as
the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and
sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we
perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed
body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual calender so that the required number of teaching days
are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation
will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at
school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus
designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring
and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child
psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance
this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for
contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring
hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group
in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for
this book, Professor B. L. Khandelwal for guiding the work of this committee.

Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful
to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions
and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their
resources, material and personnel. As an organisation committed to systemic
reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT
welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further
revision and refinement.

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOK
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on
students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the
content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative
mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to
rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed
by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:
•

Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same
class

•

Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject

•

Difficulty level

•

Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions
from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peerlearning

•

Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the
changes given above.

PREFACE
Chemistry has made a profound impact on the society. It is intimately linked
to the well-being of human kind. The rate of advancements in chemistry is so
high that curriculum developers continuously look for strategies to cope with
these advancements. Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future
leaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is
a sincere effort in this direction.
The textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen Units. Although
the titles of various Units indicate a sort of compartmentalisation into physical,
inorganic and organic chemistry, readers will find that these sub-disciplines
have been intermingled, at least to a certain extent, to have a unified approach
to the subject. First nine Units covering physical and inorganic chemistry
portions are included in Part I while organic chemistry portion comprising of
seven Units is included in Part II of the book. The approach of presentation
of the subject matter discourages students from rote memorisation. The subject
has in fact, been organised around the laws and principles of chemistry. As
students master these laws and principles, they will soon get to the point
where they can predict much of what will come.
Efforts have been directed towards making the subject stimulating and exciting
by references to the historical developments and its usefulness to our lives,
wherever appropriate. The text is well illustrated with examples from
surrounding environment to facilitate grasping of the qualitative and
quantitative aspects of the concept easily. Physical data are given in SI units
throughout the book to make comparison of various properties easier. IUPAC
system of nomenclature has been followed along with the common names.
Structural formulae of chemical compounds showing functional/coordinating
groups in different colours are drawn using electronic system. Each Unit has
a good number of examples, as illustrations, with their solutions and some
intext questions, the answers of some of which are given at the end of the Unit.
The end of Unit exercises are designed to apply important principles and
provoke thinking process to solve them. Answers of some of these exercises
are given at the end of the book.
A variety of materials, e.g., biographical sketches of some scientists, additional
information related to a particular topic, etc., is given in boxes with a deep
yellow coloured bar. This boxed material with a 'deep yellow bar' is to bring
additional life to the topic. However, it is non-evaluative. The structures of
some of the more complex compounds incorporated in the book are for
understanding their chemistry. As their reproduction would lead to
memorisation, it is also a non-evaluative portion of the text.

The information part has been significantly reduced and, wherever possible,
it has been substantiated with facts. However, it is necessary for students to
be aware of commercially important chemicals, their processes of manufacture
and sources of raw materials. This leads to descriptive material in the book.
Attempts have been made to make descriptions of such compounds interesting
by considering their structures and reactivity. Thermodynamics, kinetics and
electrochemical aspects have been applied to a few chemical reactions which
should be beneficial to students for understanding why a particular reaction
happened and why a particular property is exhibited by the product. There
is currently great awareness of environmental and energy issues which are
directly related to chemistry. Such issues have been highlighted and dealt
with at appropriate places in the book.
A team of experts constituted by the NCERT has developed the manuscript of
the book. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the valuable contribution
of all the members of this team. I also acknowledge the valuable and relentless
contribution of the editors in bringing the book to the present shape. I also
acknowledge with thanks the dedicated efforts and valuable contribution of
Professor Brahm Parkash, who not only coordinated the entire programme
but also actively involved in writing and editing of this book. Thanks are also
due to the participating teachers and subject experts of the review workshop
for their contribution, which has helped us to make the book learner friendly.
Also, I thank the technical and administrative staff of the NCERT for their
support in the entire process.
The team of this textbook development programme hopes that the book
stimulates its readers and makes them feel the excitement and fascination for
this subject. Efforts have been made to bring out this book error-free.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that in a book of this complexity, there could
inevitably be occasional errors. It will always be a pleasure to hear about
them from readers to take necessary steps to rectify them.

Haloalkanes and
Haloar
enes
Haloarenes
Halogenated compounds persist in the environment due to their
resistance to breakdown by soil bacteria.

The replacement of hydrogen atom(s) in an aliphatic
or aromatic hydrocarbon by halogen atom(s) results
in the formation of alkyl halide (haloalkane) and aryl
halide (haloarene), respectively. Haloalkanes contain
halogen atom(s) attached to the sp3 hybridised carbon
atom of an alkyl group whereas haloarenes contain
halogen atom(s) attached to sp2 hybridised carbon
atom(s) of an aryl group. Many halogen containing
organic compounds occur in nature and some of
these are clinically useful. These classes of compounds
find wide applications in industry as well as in dayto-day life. They are used as solvents for relatively
non-polar compounds and as starting materials for
the synthesis of wide range of organic compounds.
Chlorine containing antibiotic, chloramphenicol,
produced by microorganisms is very effective for the
treatment of typhoid fever. Our body produces iodine
containing hormone, thyroxine, the deficiency of which
causes a disease called goiter. Synthetic halogen
compounds, viz. chloroquine is used for the treatment
of malaria; halothane is used as an anaesthetic
during surgery. Certain fully fluorinated compounds
are being considered as potential blood substitutes
in surgery.
In this Unit, you will study the important methods
of preparation, physical and chemical properties and
uses of organohalogen compounds.

6.1 Classification

Haloalkanes and haloarenes may be classified as follows:

6.1.1 On the
Basis of
Number of
Halogen
Atoms

These may be classified as mono, di, or polyhalogen (tri-,tetra-, etc.)
compounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen
atoms in their structures. For example,

Monohalocompounds may further be classified according to the
hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the halogen is bonded, as
discussed below.
6.1.2 Compounds
Containing
sp3 C—X
Bond (X= F,
Cl, Br, I)

This class includes
(a) Alkyl halides or haloalkanes (R—X)
In alkyl halides, the halogen atom is bonded to an alkyl group (R).
They form a homologous series represented by CnH2n+1X. They are
further classified as primary, secondary or tertiary according to the
nature of carbon to which halogen is attached. If halogen is attached to
a primary carbon atom in an alkyl halide, the alkyl halide is called
primary alkyl halide or 1° alkyl halide. Similarly, if halogen is attached
to secondary or tertiary carbon atom, the alkyl halide is called
secondary alkyl halide (2°) and tertiary (3°) alkyl halide, respectively.

(b) Allylic halides
These are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to an
sp3-hybridised carbon atom adjacent to carbon-carbon double bond
(C=C) i.e. to an allylic carbon.
Allylic carbon
Allylic carbon
(c) Benzylic halides
These are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to an
sp3-hybridised carbon atom attached to an aromatic ring.

6.1.3

Compounds
Containing
sp2 C—X
Bond

This class includes:
(a) Vinylic halides
These are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to
a sp2-hybridised carbon atom of a carbon-carbon double bond
(C = C).
(b) Aryl halides
These are the compounds in which the halogen atom is directly
bonded to the sp2-hybridised carbon atom of an aromatic ring.

6.2

Nomenclature

Having learnt the classification of halogenated compounds, let us now learn
how these are named. The common names of alkyl halides are derived by
naming the alkyl group followed by the name of halide. In the IUPAC system
of nomenclature, alkyl halides are named as halosubstituted hydrocarbons.
For mono halogen substituted derivatives of benzene, common and IUPAC
names are the same. For dihalogen derivatives, the prefixes o-, m-, p- are
used in common system but in IUPAC system, as you have learnt in Class
XI, the numerals 1,2; 1,3 and 1,4 are used.

The dihaloalkanes having the same type of halogen atoms are named
as alkylidene or alkylene dihalides. The dihalo-compounds having both
the halogen atoms are further classified as geminal halides or gem-dihalides
when both the halogen atoms are present on the same carbon atom of the
161 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes

Rationalised 2023-24

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

chain and vicinal halides or vic-dihalides when halogen atoms are present
on adjacent carbon atoms. In common name system, gem-dihalides are
named as alkylidene halides and vic-dihalides are named as alkylene
dihalides. In IUPAC system, they are named as dihaloalkanes.

Some common examples of halocompounds are mentioned in Table 6.1.

6.3

Nature of
C-X Bond

Halogen atoms are more electronegative than carbon, therefore,
carbon-halogen bond of alkyl halide is polarised; the carbon atom bears
a partial positive charge whereas the halogen atom bears a partial
negative charge.

As we go down the group in the periodic table, the size of halogen
atom increases. Fluorine atom is the smallest and iodine atom is the
largest. Consequently the carbon-halogen bond length also increases
from C—F to C—I. Some typical bond lengths, bond enthalpies and
dipole moments are given in Table 6.2.
Alkyl halides are best prepared from alcohols, which are easily accessible.

6 . 4 Methods of
Preparation
of Haloalkanes
6.4.1 From Alcohols

The hydroxyl group of an alcohol is replaced by halogen on reaction with
concentrated halogen acids, phosphorus halides or thionyl chloride.
Thionyl chloride is preferred because in this reaction alkyl halide is formed
along with gases SO2 and HCl. The two gaseous products are escapable,
hence, the reaction gives pure alkyl halides. The reactions of primary and
secondary alcohols with HCl require the presence of a catalyst, ZnCl2.
With tertiary alcohols, the reaction is conducted by simply shaking the
alcohol with concentrated HCl at room temperature. Constant boiling
with HBr (48%) is used for preparing alkyl bromide. Good yields of
R—I may be obtained by heating alcohols with sodium or potassium
iodide in 95% orthophosphoric acid. The order of reactivity of alcohols
with a given haloacid is 3°>2°>1°. Phosphorus tribromide and triiodide
are usually generated in situ (produced in the reaction mixture) by the
reaction of red phosphorus with bromine and iodine respectively.

The preparation of alkyl chloride is carried out either by passing
dry hydrogen chloride gas through a solution of alcohol or by heating
a mixture of alcohol and concentrated aqueous halogen acid.
The above methods are not applicable for the preparation of aryl
halides because the carbon-oxygen bond in phenols has a partial double
bond character and is difficult to break being stronger than a single
bond.
6.4.2

From
Hydrocarbons

(I) From alkanes by free radical halogenation
Free radical chlorination or bromination of alkanes gives a complex
mixture of isomeric mono- and polyhaloalkanes, which is difficult to

Chemistry 164

separate as pure compounds. Consequently, the yield of any single
compound is low.

(II) From alkenes
(i) Addition of hydrogen halides: An alkene is converted to
corresponding alkyl halide by reaction with hydrogen chloride,
hydrogen bromide or hydrogen iodide.

Propene yields two products, however only one predominates as
per Markovnikov’s rule. (Unit 13, Class XI)

(ii) Addition of halogens: In the laboratory, addition of bromine in
CCl4 to an alkene resulting in discharge of reddish brown colour
of bromine constitutes an important method for the detection of
double bond in a molecule. The addition results in the synthesis
of vic-dibromides, which are colourless (Unit 9, Class XI).

Identify all the possible monochloro structural isomers expected to be
formed on free radical monochlorination of (CH3)2CHCH2CH3.

Example 6.3

In the given molecule, there are four different types of hydrogen atoms.
Replacement of these hydrogen atoms will give the following

Solution

(CH3)2CHCH2CH2Cl

(CH3)2CHCH(Cl)CH3

(CH3)2C(Cl)CH2CH3

CH3CH(CH2Cl)CH2CH3

6.4.3 Halogen
Exchange

Alkyl iodides are often prepared by the reaction of alkyl chlorides/
bromides with NaI in dry acetone. This reaction is known as Finkelstein
reaction.

NaCl or NaBr thus formed is precipitated in dry acetone. It facilitates
the forward reaction according to Le Chatelier’s Principle.
The synthesis of alkyl fluorides is best accomplished by heating an
alkyl chloride/bromide in the presence of a metallic fluoride such as
165 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes

AgF, Hg2F2, CoF2 or SbF3. The reaction is termed as Swarts reaction.

6.5

Preparation of (i) From hydrocarbons by electrophilic substitution
Aryl chlorides and bromides can be easily prepared by electrophilic
Haloarenes
substitution of arenes with chlorine and bromine respectively in the
presence of Lewis acid catalysts like iron or iron(III) chloride.

The ortho and para isomers can be easily separated due to large
difference in their melting points. Reactions with iodine are reversible
in nature and require the presence of an oxidising agent (HNO3,
HIO4) to oxidise the HI formed during iodination. Fluoro compounds
are not prepared by this method due to high reactivity of fluorine.
(ii) From amines by Sandmeyer’s reaction
When a primary aromatic amine, dissolved or suspended in cold
aqueous mineral acid, is treated with sodium nitrite, a diazonium
salt is formed. Mixing the solution of freshly prepared diazonium
salt with cuprous chloride or cuprous bromide results in the
replacement of the diazonium group by –Cl or –Br.

Replacement of the diazonium group by iodine does not require the
presence of cuprous halide and is done simply by shaking the diazonium
salt with potassium iodide.

Melting and boiling points
Methyl chloride, methyl bromide, ethyl chloride and some
chlorofluoromethanes are gases at room temperature. Higher members
are liquids or solids. As we have already learnt, molecules of organic
halogen compounds are generally polar. Due to greater polarity as well
as higher molecular mass as compared to the parent hydrocarbon, the
intermolecular forces of attraction (dipole-dipole and van der Waals)
are stronger in the halogen derivatives. That is why the boiling points
of chlorides, bromides and iodides are considerably higher than those
of the hydrocarbons of comparable molecular mass.
The attractions get stronger as the molecules get bigger in size and
have more electrons. The pattern of variation of boiling points of different
halides is depicted in Fig. 6.1. For the same alkyl group, the boiling
points of alkyl halides decrease in the order: RI> RBr> RCl> RF. This
is because with the increase in size and mass of halogen atom, the
magnitude of van der Waal forces increases.

Fig. 6.1: Comparison of boiling points of some alkyl halides

The boiling points of isomeric haloalkanes decrease with increase
in branching. For example, 2-bromo-2-methylpropane has the lowest
boiling point among the three isomers.

Boiling points of isomeric dihalobenzenes are very nearly the same.
However, the para-isomers are high melting as compared to their orthoand meta-isomers. It is due to symmetry of para-isomers that fits in
crystal lattice better as compared to ortho- and meta-isomers.

Density
Bromo, iodo and polychloro derivatives of hydrocarbons are heavier than
water. The density increases with increase in number of carbon atoms,
halogen atoms and atomic mass of the halogen atoms (Table 6.3).

Solubility
The haloalkanes are very slightly soluble in water. In order to dissolve
haloalkane in water, energy is required to overcome the attractions between
the haloalkane molecules and break the hydrogen bonds between water
molecules. Less energy is released when new attractions are set up between
the haloalkane and the water molecules as these are not as strong as the
original hydrogen bonds in water. As a result, the solubility of haloalkanes
in water is low. However, haloalkanes tend to dissolve in organic solvents
because the new intermolecular attractions between haloalkanes and
solvent molecules have much the same strength as the ones being broken
in the separate haloalkane and solvent molecules.

Reactions
6.7.1

Reactions of
Haloalkanes

The reactions of haloalkanes may be divided into the following categories:
1. Nucleophilic substitution
2. Elimination reactions
3. Reaction with metals.
(1) Nucleophilic substitution reactions
You have learnt in Class XI that nucleophiles are electron rich species.
Therefore, they attack at that part of the substrate molecule which
is electron deficient. The reaction in which a nucleophile replaces

169 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes

Rationalised 2023-24

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

already existing nucleophile in a molecule is called nucleophilic
substitution reaction. Haloalkanes are substrate in these reactions.
In this type of reaction, a nucleophile reacts with haloalkane (the
substrate) having a partial positive charge on the carbon atom bonded
to halogen. A substitution reaction takes place and halogen atom,
called leaving group departs as halide ion. Since the substitution
reaction is initiated by a nucleophile, it is called nucleophilic
substitution reaction.

It is one of the most useful classes of organic reactions of alkyl
halides in which halogen is bonded to sp3 hybridised carbon. The
products formed by the reaction of haloalkanes with some common
nucleophiles are given in Table 6.4.

Haloalkanes react with KCN to form alkyl cyanides as main product
while AgCN forms isocyanides as the chief product. Explain.

Example 6.5

KCN is predominantly ionic and provides cyanide ions in solution.
Although both carbon and nitrogen atoms are in a position to donate
electron pairs, the attack takes place mainly through carbon atom and
not through nitrogen atom since C—C bond is more stable than C—N
bond. However, AgCN is mainly covalent in nature and nitrogen is free
to donate electron pair forming isocyanide as the main product.

Solution

carbon atom resulting in alkyl cyanides and through nitrogen atom
leading to isocyanides. Similarly nitrite ion also represents
an ambident
ii
nucleophile with two different points of linkage [–O— N =O]. The linkage
through oxygen results in alkyl nitrites while through nitrogen atom, it
leads to nitroalkanes.
Mechanism: This reaction has been found to proceed by two different
mechanims which are described below:
(a) Substitution nucleophilic bimolecular (SN2)
The reaction between CH3Cl and hydroxide ion to yield methanol and
chloride ion follows a second order kinetics, i.e., the rate depends
upon the concentration of both the reactants.

The solid wedge represents the bond coming out of the paper, dashed line going down the
paper and a straight line representing bond in the plane of the paper.

The above reaction can be represented diagrammatically as shown in
Fig. 6.2.

Fig. 6.2:

In the year 1937,
Edward Davies Hughes
and Sir Christopher
Ingold proposed a
mechanism for an SN2
reaction.

Red ball represents the incoming hydroxide ion and green ball represents
the outgoing halide ion

It depicts a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction;
the incoming nucleophile interacts with alkyl halide causing the
carbon-halide bond to break and a new bond is formed between
carbon and attacking nucleophile. Here it is C-O bond formed between
C and -OH. These two processes take place simultaneously in a
171 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes

Rationalised 2023-24

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

single step and no intermediate is formed. As the reaction progresses
and the bond between the incoming nucleophile and the carbon
atom starts forming, the bond between carbon atom and leaving
group weakens. As this happens, the three carbon-hydrogen bonds
of the substrate start moving away from the attacking nucleophile. In
transition state all the three C-H bonds are in the same plane and the
attacking and leaving nucleophiles are partially attached to the
carbon. As the attacking nucleophile approaches closer to the carbon,
C-H bonds still keep on moving in the same direction till the attacking
nucleophile attaches to carbon and leaving group leaves the carbon.
As a result configuration is inverted, the configuration (See box) of
carbon atom under attack inverts in much the same way as an
umbrella is turned inside out when caught in a strong wind. This
process is called as inversion of configuration. In the transition
state, the carbon atom is simultaneously bonded to incoming
nucleophile and the outgoing leaving group. Such structures are
unstable and cannot be isolated. Thus, in the transition state, carbon
is simultaneously bonded to five atoms.

Configuration
Spacial arrangement of functional groups around carbon is called its configuration.
See the structures (A) and (B) given below carefully.

These are the two structures of the same compound. They differ in spacial arrangement
of functional groups attached to carbon. Structure (A) is mirror image of Structure (B).
We say configuration of carbon in structure (A) is mirror image of the configuration of
carbon in structure (B).

Ingold and earned a

Since this reaction requires the approach of the nucleophile to the
carbon bearing the leaving group, the presence of bulky substituents
on or near the carbon atom have a dramatic inhibiting effect. Of the
simple alkyl halides, methyl halides react most rapidly in SN2 reactions
because there are only three small hydrogen atoms. Tertiary halides
are the least reactive because bulky groups hinder the approaching

nucleophiles. Thus the order of reactivity followed is:
Primary halide > Secondary halide > Tertiary halide.

(b) Substitution nucleophilic unimolecular (SN1)
SN1 reactions are generally carried out in polar protic solvents
(like water, alcohol, acetic acid, etc.). The reaction between tertbutyl bromide and hydroxide ion yields tert-butyl alcohol and
follows the first order kinetics, i.e., the rate of reaction depends
upon the concentration of only one reactant, which is tert- butyl
bromide.

It occurs in two steps. In step I, the polarised C—Br bond undergoes
slow cleavage to produce a carbocation and a bromide ion. The
carbocation thus formed is then attacked by nucleophile in step II
to complete the substitution reaction.

Step I is the slowest and reversible. It involves the C–Br bond breaking for which the
energy is obtained through solvation of halide ion with the proton of protic solvent. Since
the rate of reaction depends upon the slowest step, the rate of reaction depends only on the
concentration of alkyl halide and not on the concentration of hydroxide ion. Further, greater
the stability of carbocation, greater will be its ease of formation from alkyl halide and faster
will be the rate of reaction. In case of alkyl halides, 30 alkyl halides undergo SN1 reaction
0
very fast because of the high stability of 3 carbocations. We can sum up the order of reactivity
of alkyl halides towards S N1 and SN2 reactions as follows:

For the same reasons, allylic and benzylic halides show high reactivity towards the SN1
reaction. The carbocation thus formed gets stabilised through resonance (Unit 8, Class XI) as

CH3CH2CH2CH2Br > (CH3)2CHCH2Br > CH3CH2CH(Br)CH3 > (CH3)3CBr (SN2)
Of the two primary bromides, the carbocation intermediate derived from
(CH3)2CHCH2Br is more stable than derived from CH3CH2CH2CH2Br because
of greater electron donating inductive effect of (CH3)2CH- group. Therefore,
(CH3)2CHCH2Br is more reactive than CH3CH2CH2CH2Br in SN1 reactions.
CH3CH2CH(Br)CH3 is a secondary bromide and (CH3)3CBr is a tertiary
bromide. Hence the above order is followed in SN1. The reactivity in SN2
reactions follows the reverse order as the steric hinderance around the
electrophilic carbon increases in that order.
(ii) C6H5C(CH3)(C6H5)Br > C6H5CH(C6H5)Br > C6H5CH(CH3)Br > C6H5CH2Br (SN1)
C6H5C(CH3)(C6H5)Br < C6H5CH(C6H5)Br < C6H5CH(CH3)Br < C6H5CH2Br (SN2)
Of the two secondary bromides, the carbocation intermediate obtained
from C6H5CH(C6H5)Br is more stable than obtained from C6H5CH(CH3)Br
because it is stabilised by two phenyl groups due to resonance. Therefore,
the former bromide is more reactive than the latter in SN1 reactions. A
phenyl group is bulkier than a methyl group. Therefore, C6H5CH(C6H5)Br
is less reactive than C6H5CH(CH3)Br in SN2 reactions.

William Nicol (17681851) developed the first
prism that produced
plane polarised light.

(c) Stereochemical aspects of nucleophilic substitution reactions
In order to understand the stereochemical aspects of substitution
reactions, we need to learn some basic stereochemical principles
and notations (optical activity, chirality, retention, inversion,
racemisation, etc.).
(i) Optical activity: Plane of plane polarised light produced by
passing ordinary light through Nicol prism is rotated when it
is passed through the solutions of certain compounds. Such
compounds are called optically active compounds. The angle
by which the plane polarised light is rotated is measured by an
instrument called polarimeter. If the compound rotates the plane
of plane polarised light to the right, i.e., clockwise direction, it
is called dextrorotatory (Greek for right rotating) or the d-form
and is indicated by placing a positive (+) sign before the degree
of rotation. If the light is rotated towards left (anticlockwise
direction), the compound is said to be laevo-rotatory or the
l-form and a negative (–) sign is placed before the degree of
rotation. Such (+) and (–) isomers of a compound are called
optical isomers and the phenomenon is termed as optical
isomerism.
(ii) Molecular asymmetry, chirality and enantiomers: The
observation of Louis Pasteur (1848) that crystals of certain
compounds exist in the form of mirror images laid the
foundation of modern stereochemistry. He demonstrated that
aqueous solutions of both types of crystals showed optical
rotation, equal in magnitude (for solution of equal concentration)
but opposite in direction. He believed that this difference in
optical activity was associated with the three dimensional
arrangements of atoms in the molecules (configurations) of

scientist, C. Le Bel in the same year (1874), independently
argued that the spatial arrangement of four groups (valencies)

as asymmetric molecule. The asymmetry of the molecule along
with non superimposability of mirror images is responsible for
the optical activity in such organic compounds.
The symmetry and asymmetry are also observed in many day to day
objects: a sphere, a cube, a cone, are all identical to
their mirror images and can be superimposed.
However, many objects are non superimposable on
their mirror images. For example, your left and right
hand look similar but if you put your left hand on
your right hand by moving them in the same plane,
they do not coincide. The objects which are nonsuperimposable on their mirror image (like a pair
of hands) are said to be chiral and this property is
known as chirality. Chiral molecules are optically
active, while the objects, which are, superimposable
on their mirror images are called achiral. These
molecules are optically inactive.
The above test of molecular chirality can be
applied to organic molecules by constructing
models and its mirror images or by drawing three
dimensional structures and attempting to
superimpose them in our minds. There are other
aids, however, that can assist us in recognising
Fig 6.4: Some common examples of chiral and chiral molecules. One such aid is the presence of
a single asymmetric carbon atom. Let us consider
achiral objects
two simple molecules propan-2-ol (Fig.6.5) and butan-2-ol (Fig.6.6)
and their mirror images.

Fig 6.5:

B is mirror image of A; B is rotated by 180o and C is
obtained; C is superimposable on A.

As you can see very clearly, propan-2-ol (A) does not contain an asymmetric
carbon, as all the four groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon are not
different. We rotate the mirror image (B) of the molecule by 180° (structure
C) and try to overlap the structure (C) with the structure (A), these structures
completely overlap. Thus propan-2-ol is an achiral molecule.

Fig. 6.7:

A chiral molecule
and its mirror image

The stereoisomers related to each other as nonsuperimposable mirror images are called enantiomers
(Fig. 6.7). A and B in Fig. 6.5 and D and E in Fig. 6.6 are
enantiomers.
Enantiomers possess identical physical properties namely,
melting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc. They only differ
with respect to the rotation of plane polarised light. If one of the
enantiomer is dextro rotatory, the other will be laevo rotatory.
However, the sign of optical rotation is not necessarily related to
the absolute (actual) configuration of the molecule.

A mixture containing two enantiomers in equal proportions
will have zero optical rotation, as the rotation due to one isomer
will be cancelled by the rotation due to the other isomer. Such
a mixture is known as racemic mixture or racemic
modification. A racemic mixture is represented by prefixing dl
or (±) before the name, for example (±) butan-2-ol. The process
of conversion of enantiomer into a racemic mixture is known as
racemisation.

Solution

(iii) Retention: Retention of configuration is the preservation of the spatial
arrangement of bonds to an asymmetric centre during a chemical
reaction or transformation.
In general, if during a reaction, no bond to the stereocentre is broken,
the product will have the same general configuration of groups
around the stereocentre as that of reactant. Such a reaction is said
to proceed with retention of the configuration. Consider as an
example, the reaction that takes place when (–)-2-methylbutan-1-ol
is heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid.

It is important to note that configuration at a symmetric centre in
the reactant and product is same but the sign of optical rotation
has changed in the product. This is so because two different
compounds with same configuration at asymmetric centre may have
different optical rotation. One may be dextrorotatory (plus sign of
optical rotation) while other may be laevorotatory (negative sign of
optical rotation).
(iv) Inversion, retention and racemisation: There are three outcomes
for a reaction at an asymmetric carbon atom, when a bond directly
linked to an asymmetric carbon atom is broken. Consider the
replacement of a group X by Y in the following reaction;

If (A) is the only compound obtained, the process is called retention
of configuration. Note that configuration has been rotated in A.
If (B) is the only compound obtained, the process is called inversion
of configuration. Configuration has been inverted in B.
Chemistry 178

Rationalised 2023-24

If a 50:50 mixture of A and B is obtained then the process is called
racemisation and the product is optically inactive, as one isomer will
rotate the plane polarised light in the direction opposite to another.
Now let us have a fresh look at SN1 and SN2 mechanisms by
taking examples of optically active alkyl halides.
In case of optically active alkyl halides, the product formed as a
result of SN2 mechanism has the inverted configuration as compared
to the reactant. This is because the nucleophile attaches itself on the
side opposite to the one where the halogen atom is present. When
(–)-2-bromooctane is allowed to react with sodium hydroxide,
(+)-octan-2-ol is formed with the –OH group occupying the position
opposite to what bromide had occupied.

Thus, SN2 reactions of optically active halides are accompanied by
inversion of configuration.
In case of optically active alkyl halides, S N1 reactions are
accompanied by racemisation. Can you think of the reason why it
2
happens? Actually the carbocation formed in the slow step being sp
hybridised is planar (achiral). The attack of the nucleophile may be
accomplished from either side of the plane of carbocation resulting in
a mixture of products, one having the same configuration (the –OH

attaching on the same position as halide ion) and the other having
opposite configuration (the –OH attaching on the side opposite to halide
ion). This may be illustrated by hydrolysis of optically active
2-bromobutane, which results in the formation of (±)-butan-2-ol.
2. Elimination reactions
When a haloalkane with b-hydrogen atom is heated with alcoholic
solution of potassium hydroxide, there is elimination of hydrogen
atom from b-carbon and a halogen atom from the a-carbon atom.

179 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes

Rationalised 2023-24

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

As a result, an alkene is formed as a product. Since b-hydrogen
atom is involved in elimination, it is often called b-elimination.
If there is possibility of formation of more than one alkene due to
the availability of more than one b-hydrogen atoms, usually one alkene
is formed as the major product. These form part of a pattern first
observed by Russian chemist, Alexander Zaitsev (also pronounced as
Saytzeff) who in 1875 formulated a rule which can be summarised as
“in dehydrohalogenation reactions, the preferred product is that
alkene which has the greater number of alkyl groups attached to the
doubly bonded carbon atoms.” Thus, 2-bromopentane gives
pent-2-ene as the major product.

Elimination versus substitution
A chemical reaction is the result of competition; it is a race that is won by the fastest
runner. A collection of molecules tend to do, by and large, what is easiest for them. An
alkyl halide with b-hydrogen atoms when reacted with a base or a nucleophile has two
competing routes: substitution (SN1 and SN2) and elimination. Which route will be taken
up depends upon the nature of alkyl halide, strength and size of base/nucleophile and
reaction conditions. Thus, a bulkier nucleophile will prefer to act as a base and abstracts
a proton rather than approach a tetravalent carbon atom (steric reasons) and vice versa.
Similarly, a primary alkyl halide will prefer a SN2 reaction, a secondary halide- SN2 or
elimination depending upon the strength of base/nucleophile and a tertiary halide- SN1 or
elimination depending upon the stability of carbocation or the more substituted alkene.

3. Reaction with metals
Most organic chlorides, bromides and iodides react with certain
metals to give compounds containing carbon-metal bonds. Such
compounds are known as organo-metallic compounds. An
important class of organo-metallic compounds discovered by Victor
Grignard in 1900 is alkyl magnesium halide, RMgX, referred as
Grignard Reagents. These reagents are obtained by the reaction of
haloalkanes with magnesium metal in dry ether.

Chemistry 180

Victor Grignard had a strange start in academic life for a chemist - he
took a maths degree. When he eventually switched to chemistry, it was
not to the mathematical province of physical chemistry but to organic
chemistry. While attempting to find an efficient catalyst for the process
of methylation, he noted that Zn in diethyl ether had been used for this
purpose and wondered whether the Mg/ether combination might be
successful. Grignard reagents were first reported in 1900 and Grignard
used this work for his doctoral thesis in 1901. In 1910, Grignard obtained
a professorship at the University of Nancy and in 1912, he was awarded
the Nobel prize for Chemistry which he shared with Paul Sabatier who
had made advances in nickel catalysed hydrogenation.

In the Grignard reagent, the carbon-magnesium bond is covalent
but highly polar, with carbon pulling electrons from electropositive
magnesium; the magnesium halogen bond is essentially ionic.

Grignard reagents are highly reactive and react with any source of
proton to give hydrocarbons. Even water, alcohols, amines are sufficiently
acidic to convert them to corresponding hydrocarbons.
It is therefore necessary to avoid even traces of moisture from a Grignard
reagent. That is why reaction is carried out in dry ether. On the other
hand, this could be considered as one of the methods for converting
halides to hydrocarbons.
Wurtz reaction
Alkyl halides react with sodium in dry ether to give hydrocarbons
containing double the number of carbon atoms present in the halide.
This reaction is known as Wurtz reaction.
6.7.2 Reactions of
Haloarenes

1. Nucleophilic substitution
Aryl halides are extremely less reactive towards nucleophilic
substitution reactions due to the following reasons:
(i) Resonance effect : In haloarenes, the electron pairs on halogen
atom are in conjugation with p-electrons of the ring and the
following resonating structures are possible.

C—Cl bond acquires a partial double bond character due to
resonance. As a result, the bond cleavage in haloarene is difficult
than haloalkane and therefore, they are less reactive towards
nucleophilic substitution reaction.
181 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes

Rationalised 2023-24

(ii) Difference in hybridisation of carbon atom in C—X bond: In
haloalkane, the carbon atom attached to halogen is sp3
hybridised while in case of haloarene, the carbon atom attached
to halogen is sp2-hybridised.

The sp2 hybridised carbon with a greater s-character is more
electronegative and can hold the electron pair of C—X bond
more tightly than sp3-hybridised carbon in haloalkane with
less s-chararcter. Thus, C—Cl bond length in haloalkane is
177pm while in haloarene is 169 pm. Since it is difficult to
break a shorter bond than a longer bond, therefore, haloarenes
are less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic
substitution reaction.
(iii) Instability of phenyl cation: In case of haloarenes, the phenyl
cation formed as a result of self-ionisation will not be stabilised
by resonance and therefore, SN1 mechanism is ruled out.
(iv) Because of the possible repulsion, it is less likely for the electron
rich nucleophile to approach electron rich arenes.
Replacement by hydroxyl group
Chlorobenzene can be converted into phenol by heating in aqueous
sodium hydroxide solution at a temperature of 623K and a pressure
of 300 atmospheres.

The presence of an electron withdrawing group (-NO2) at ortho- and
para-positions increases the reactivity of haloarenes.

Chemistry 182

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

The effect is pronounced when (-NO2) group is introduced at orthoand para- positions. However, no effect on reactivity of haloarenes is
observed by the presence of electron withdrawing group at meta-position.
Mechanism of the reaction is as depicted:

Can you think why does NO2 group show its effect only at ortho- and para- positions
and not at meta- position?
As shown, the presence of nitro group at ortho- and para-positions withdraws the
electron density from the benzene ring and thus facilitates the attack of the nucleophile
on haloarene. The carbanion thus formed is stabilised through resonance. The negative
charge appeared at ortho- and para- positions with respect to the halogen substituent is
stabilised by –NO2 group while in case of meta-nitrobenzene, none of the resonating
structures bear the negative charge on carbon atom bearing the –NO2 group. Therefore,
the presence of nitro group at meta- position does not stabilise the negative charge and
no effect on reactivity is observed by the presence of –NO2 group at meta-position.

2. Electrophilic substitution reactions
Haloarenes undergo the usual electrophilic reactions of the benzene
ring such as halogenation, nitration, sulphonation and Friedel-Crafts
reactions. Halogen atom besides being slightly deactivating is o, pdirecting; therefore, further substitution occurs at ortho- and parapositions with respect to the halogen atom. The o, p-directing influence
of halogen atom can be easily understood if we consider the resonating
structures of halobenzene as shown:

Due to resonance, the electron density increases more at ortho- and
para-positions than at meta-positions. Further, the halogen atom
because of its –I effect has some tendency to withdraw electrons from
the benzene ring. As a result, the ring gets somewhat deactivated as
compared to benzene and hence the electrophilic substitution reactions
in haloarenes occur slowly and require more drastic conditions as
compared to those in benzene.

(iv) Friedel-Crafts reaction

Example 6.9 Although chlorine is an electron withdrawing group, yet it is ortho-,
para- directing in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Why?

Solution Chlorine withdraws electrons through inductive effect and releases
electrons through resonance. Through inductive effect, chlorine
destabilises the intermediate carbocation formed during the electrophilic
substitution.

Through resonance, halogen tends to stabilise the carbocation and
the effect is more pronounced at ortho- and para- positions. The
inductive effect is stronger than resonance and causes net electron
withdrawal and thus causes net deactivation. The resonance effect
tends to oppose the inductive effect for the attack at ortho- and parapositions and hence makes the deactivation less for ortho- and paraattack. Reactivity is thus controlled by the stronger inductive effect
and orientation is controlled by resonance effect.

6 . 8 Polyhalogen
Compounds

Carbon compounds containing more than one halogen atom are usually
referred to as polyhalogen compounds. Many of these compounds are
useful in industry and agriculture. Some polyhalogen compounds are
described in this section.

6.8.1

Dichloromethane
(Methylene
chloride)

Dichloromethane is widely used as a solvent as a paint remover, as a
propellant in aerosols, and as a process solvent in the manufacture of
drugs. It is also used as a metal cleaning and finishing solvent. Methylene
chloride harms the human central nervous system. Exposure to lower
levels of methylene chloride in air can lead to slightly impaired hearing
and vision. Higher levels of methylene chloride in air cause dizziness,
nausea, tingling and numbness in the fingers and toes. In humans, direct
skin contact with methylene chloride causes intense burning and mild
redness of the skin. Direct contact with the eyes can burn the cornea.

6.8.2

Chemically, chloroform is employed as a solvent for fats, alkaloids,
Trichloroiodine and other substances. The major use of chloroform today is in
methane
(Chloroform) the production of the freon refrigerant R-22. It was once used as a
general anaesthetic in surgery but has been replaced by less toxic,
safer anaesthetics, such as ether. As might be expected from its use as
an anaesthetic, inhaling chloroform vapours depresses the central
nervous system. Breathing about 900 parts of chloroform per million
parts of air (900 parts per million) for a short time can cause dizziness,
fatigue, and headache. Chronic chloroform exposure may cause damage
to the liver (where chloroform is metabolised to phosgene) and to the
kidneys, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in
chloroform. Chloroform is slowly oxidised by air in the presence of
light to an extremely poisonous gas, carbonyl chloride, also known as
phosgene. It is therefore stored in closed dark coloured bottles
completely filled so that air is kept out.

6.8.3

Triiodomethane
(Iodoform)

6.8.4

It is produced in large quantities for use in the manufacture of
Tetrachlorefrigerants and propellants for aerosol cans. It is also used as
romethane
feedstock in the synthesis of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals,
(Carbon
tetrachloride) pharmaceutical manufacturing, and general solvent use. Until the mid
1960s, it was also widely used as a cleaning fluid, both in industry,
as a degreasing agent, and in the home, as a spot remover and as fire
extinguisher. There is some evidence that exposure to carbon
tetrachloride causes liver cancer in humans. The most common effects
are dizziness, light headedness, nausea and vomiting, which can cause
permanent damage to nerve cells. In severe cases, these effects can lead
rapidly to stupor, coma, unconsciousness or death. Exposure to CCl4
can make the heart beat irregularly or stop. The chemical may irritate
the eyes on contact. When carbon tetrachloride is released into the air,
it rises to the atmosphere and depletes the ozone layer. Depletion of the

It was used earlier as an antiseptic but the antiseptic properties are
due to the liberation of free iodine and not due to iodoform itself. Due
to its objectionable smell, it has been replaced by other formulations
containing iodine.

ozone layer is believed to increase human exposure to ultraviolet rays,
leading to increased skin cancer, eye diseases and disorders, and
possible disruption of the immune system.
6.8.5 Freons

6.8.6

The chlorofluorocarbon compounds of methane and ethane are collectively
known as freons. They are extremely stable, unreactive, non-toxic, noncorrosive and easily liquefiable gases. Freon 12 (CCl2F2) is one of the
most common freons in industrial use. It is manufactured from
tetrachloromethane by Swarts reaction. These are usually produced
for aerosol propellants, refrigeration and air conditioning purposes. By
1974, total freon production in the world was about 2 billion pounds
annually. Most freon, even that used in refrigeration, eventually makes
its way into the atmosphere where it diffuses unchanged into the
stratosphere. In stratosphere, freon is able to initiate radical chain
reactions that can upset the natural ozone balance.

p,p’-Dichlo- DDT, the first chlorinated organic insecticides, was originally prepared
rodiphenyl- in 1873, but it was not until 1939 that Paul Muller of Geigy
Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland discovered the effectiveness of DDT as
trichloroethane(DDT) an insecticide. Paul Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine
and Physiology in 1948 for this discovery. The use of DDT increased
enormously on a worldwide basis after World War II, primarily because
of its effectiveness against the mosquito that spreads malaria and lice
that carry typhus. However, problems related to extensive use of DDT
began to appear in the late 1940s. Many species of insects developed
resistance to DDT, and it was also discovered to have a high toxicity
towards fish. The chemical stability of DDT and its fat solubility
compounded the problem. DDT is not metabolised very rapidly by
animals; instead, it is deposited and stored in the fatty tissues. If
ingestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal
over time. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1973,
although it is still in use in some other parts of the world.

Summary
Alkyl/ Aryl halides may be classified as mono, di, or polyhalogen (tri-, tetra-, etc.)
compounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen atoms in
their structures. Since halogen atoms are more electronegative than carbon, the carbonhalogen bond of alkyl halide is polarised; the carbon atom bears a partial positive
charge, and the halogen atom bears a partial negative charge.
Alkyl halides are prepared by the free radical halogenation of alkanes, addition
of halogen acids to alkenes, replacement of –OH group of alcohols with halogens using

phosphorus halides, thionyl chloride or halogen acids. Aryl halides are prepared by
electrophilic substitution to arenes. Fluorides and iodides are best prepared by halogen
exchange method.
The boiling points of organohalogen compounds are comparatively higher than the
corresponding hydrocarbons because of strong dipole-dipole and van der Waals forces
of attraction. These are slightly soluble in water but completely soluble in organic
solvents.
The polarity of carbon-halogen bond of alkyl halides is responsible for their
nucleophilic substitution, elimination and their reaction with metal atoms to form
organometallic compounds. Nucleophilic substitution reactions are categorised into
SN1 and SN2 on the basis of their kinetic properties. Chirality has a profound role in
understanding the reaction mechanisms of SN1 and SN2 reactions. SN2 reactions of
chiral alkyl halides are characterised by the inversion of configuration while SN1 reactions
are characterised by racemisation.
A number of polyhalogen compounds e.g., dichloromethane, chloroform, iodoform,
carbon tetrachloride, freon and DDT have many industrial applications. However,
some of these compounds cannot be easily decomposed and even cause depletion of
ozone layer and are proving environmental hazards.

ethers according to the IUPAC
system of nomenclature;

the preparation of alcohols from
alkenes, aldehydes, ketones and
carboxylic acids;

Alcohols
Alcohols,, Phenols
and Ether
therss
Alcohols, phenols and ethers are the basic compounds for the
formation of detergents, antiseptics and fragrances, respectively.

You have learnt that substitution of one or more
hydrogen atom(s) from a hydrocarbon by another atom
or a group of atoms result in the formation of an entirely
new compound having altogether different properties
and applications. Alcohols and phenols are formed
when a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon, aliphatic and
aromatic respectively, is replaced by –OH group. These
classes of compounds find wide applications in industry
as well as in day-to-day life. For instance, have you
ever noticed that ordinary spirit used for polishing
wooden furniture is chiefly a compound containing
hydroxyl group, ethanol. The sugar we eat, the cotton
used for fabrics, the paper we use for writing, are all
made up of compounds containing –OH groups. Just
think of life without paper; no note-books, books, newspapers, currency notes, cheques, certificates, etc. The
magazines carrying beautiful photographs and
interesting stories would disappear from our life. It
would have been really a different world.
An alcohol contains one or more hydroxyl (OH)
group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s), of an
aliphatic system (CH3OH) while a phenol contains –OH
group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s) of an
aromatic system (C6H5OH).
The substitution of a hydrogen atom in a
hydrocarbon by an alkoxy or aryloxy group
(R–O/Ar–O) yields another class of compounds known
as ‘ethers’, for example, CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether). You
may also visualise ethers as compounds formed by

substituting the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of an alcohol or
phenol by an alkyl or aryl group.
In this unit, we shall discuss the chemistry of three classes of
compounds, namely — alcohols, phenols and ethers.

7.1 Classification

7.1.1

Alcohols—
Mono, Di,
Tri or
Polyhydric
alcohols

The classification of compounds makes their study systematic and
hence simpler. Therefore, let us first learn how are alcohols, phenols
and ethers classified?
Alcohols and phenols may be classified as mono–, di–, tri- or
polyhydric compounds depending on whether they contain one, two,
three or many hydroxyl groups respectively in their structures as
given below:

Monohydric

Trihydric

Dihydric

Monohydric alcohols may be further classified according to the
hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is
attached.
(i) Compounds containing Csp 3  OH bond: In this class of alcohols,
3

the –OH group is attached to an sp hybridised carbon atom of an
alkyl group. They are further classified as follows:
Primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols: In these three types of
alcohols, the –OH group is attached to primary, secondary and
tertiary carbon atom, respectively as depicted below:

Allylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached to
3
a sp hybridised carbon adjacent to the carbon-carbon double
bond, that is to an allylic carbon. For example

Benzylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached
3
to a sp —hybridised carbon atom next to an aromatic ring. For
example.

Allylic and benzylic alcohols may be primary, secondary or tertiary.
(ii) Compounds containing Csp 2  OH bond: These alcohols contain
—OH group bonded to a carbon-carbon double bond, i.e., to a
vinylic carbon or to an aryl carbon. These alcohols are also known
as vinylic alcohols.
Vinylic alcohol: CH2 = CH – OH

Phenols—
Mono, Di
and
trihydric
phenols
Monohydric

7.1.3

Ethers are classified as simple or symmetrical, if the alkyl or aryl
groups attached to the oxygen atom are the same, and mixed or
unsymmetrical, if the two groups are different. Diethyl ether,
C2H5OC2H5, is a symmetrical ether whereas C2H5OCH3 and C2H5OC6H5
are unsymmetrical ethers.

According to IUPAC system, the name of an alcohol is derived from the
name of the alkane from which the alcohol is derived, by substituting ‘e’
of alkane with the suffix ‘ol’. The position of substituents are indicated
by numerals. For this, the longest carbon chain (parent chain) is
numbered starting at the end nearest to the hydroxyl group. The positions
of the –OH group and other substituents are indicated by using the
numbers of carbon atoms to which these are attached. For naming
polyhydric alcohols, the ‘e’ of alkane is retained and the ending ‘ol’ is
added. The number of –OH groups is indicated by adding the
multiplicative prefix, di, tri, etc., before ‘ol’. The positions of –OH groups
are indicated by appropriate locants, e.g., HO–CH2–CH2–OH is named as
ethane–1, 2-diol. Table 7.1 gives common and IUPAC names of a few
alcohols as examples.

If both the alkyl groups are the same, the prefix ‘di’ is added before the alkyl
group. For example, C2H5OC2H5 is diethyl ether.
According to IUPAC system of nomenclature, ethers are regarded as
hydrocarbon derivatives in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by an
–OR or –OAr group, where R and Ar represent alkyl and aryl groups,
respectively. The larger (R) group is chosen as the parent hydrocarbon.
The names of a few ethers are given as examples in Table 7.2.

The bond angle

in alcohols is slightly less than the tetrahedral

angle (109°-28¢). It is due to the repulsion between the unshared
electron pairs of oxygen. In phenols, the –OH group is attached to sp2
hybridised carbon of an aromatic ring. The carbon– oxygen bond
length (136 pm) in phenol is slightly less than that in methanol. This
is due to (i) partial double bond character on account of the conjugation
of unshared electron pair of oxygen with the aromatic ring
2
(Section 7.4.4) and (ii) sp hybridised state of carbon to which oxygen
is attached.
In ethers, the four electron pairs, i.e., the two bond pairs and two
lone pairs of electrons on oxygen are arranged approximately in a
tetrahedral arrangement. The bond angle is slightly greater than the
tetrahedral angle due to the repulsive interaction between the two
bulky (–R) groups. The C–O bond length (141 pm) is almost the same
as in alcohols.

7.4 Alcohols and
Phenols

7.4.1 Preparation of Alcohols
Alcohols are prepared by the following methods:
1. From alkenes
(i) By acid catalysed hydration: Alkenes react with water in the
presence of acid as catalyst to form alcohols. In case of
unsymmetrical alkenes, the addition reaction takes place in
accordance with Markovnikov’s rule.

Mechanism
The mechanism of the reaction involves the following three steps:
Step 1: Protonation of alkene to form carbocation by electrophilic
+
attack of H3O .
+
+
H2O + H ® H3O

Step 2: Nucleophilic attack of water on carbocation.

Step 3: Deprotonation to form an alcohol.

Hydroboration oxidation was first
reported by H.C.
Brown in 1959. For
his studies on boron
containing organic
compounds, Brown
shared the 1979 Nobel
prize in Chemistry
with G. Wittig.

(ii) By hydroboration–oxidation: Diborane (BH3)2 reacts with alkenes
to give trialkyl boranes as addition product. This is oxidised to
alcohol by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aqueous sodium
hydroxide.

The addition of borane to the double bond takes place in such
2
a manner that the boron atom gets attached to the sp carbon
carrying greater number of hydrogen atoms. The alcohol so formed
looks as if it has been formed by the addition of water to the
alkene in a way opposite to the Markovnikov’s rule. In this reaction,
alcohol is obtained in excellent yield.
2. From carbonyl compounds
(i) By reduction of aldehydes and ketones: Aldehydes and ketones
are reduced to the corresponding alcohols by addition of
hydrogen in the presence of catalysts (catalytic hydrogenation).
The usual catalyst is a finely divided metal such as platinum,
palladium or nickel. It is also prepared by treating aldehydes
and ketones with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or lithium
aluminium hydride (LiAlH4). Aldehydes yield primary alcohols
whereas ketones give secondary alcohols.

The numbers in front
of the reagents along
the arrow indicate
that the second
reagent is added only
when the reaction
with first is complete.

(ii) By reduction of carboxylic acids and esters: Carboxylic acids
are reduced to primary alcohols in excellent yields by lithium
aluminium hydride, a strong reducing agent.

(ii) H2O

However, LiAlH4 is an expensive reagent, and therefore, used

presence of catalyst (catalytic hydrogenation).

3. From Grignard reagents
Alcohols are produced by the reaction of Grignard reagents (Unit 6,
Class XII) with aldehydes and ketones.
The first step of the reaction is the nucleophilic addition of Grignard
reagent to the carbonyl group to form an adduct. Hydrolysis of the
adduct yields an alcohol.

Chlorobenzene is fused with NaOH at 623K and 320 atmospheric
pressure. Phenol is obtained by acidification of sodium phenoxide so

2. From benzenesulphonic acid
Benzene is sulphonated with oleum and benzene sulphonic acid so
formed is converted to sodium phenoxide on heating with molten
sodium hydroxide. Acidification of the sodium salt gives phenol.

3. From diazonium salts
A diazonium salt is formed by treating an aromatic primary amine
with nitrous acid (NaNO2 + HCl) at 273-278 K. Diazonium salts are
hydrolysed to phenols by warming with water or by treating with
dilute acids (Unit 9, Class XII).

Physical
Properties

Alcohols and phenols consist of two parts, an alkyl/aryl group and a
hydroxyl group. The properties of alcohols and phenols are chiefly due
to the hydroxyl group. The nature of alkyl and aryl groups simply
modify these properties.
Boiling Points
The boiling points of alcohols and phenols increase with increase in the
number of carbon atoms (increase in van der Waals forces). In alcohols,
the boiling points decrease with increase of branching in carbon chain
(because of decrease in van der Waals forces with decrease in surface
area).
The –OH group in alcohols and phenols is involved in intermolecular
hydrogen bonding as shown below:

It is interesting to note that boiling points of alcohols and phenols
are higher in comparison to other classes of compounds, namely
hydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes of comparable
molecular masses. For example, ethanol and propane have comparable
molecular masses but their boiling points differ widely. The boiling
point of methoxymethane is intermediate of the two boiling points.

The high boiling points of alcohols are mainly due to the presence
of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in them which is lacking in ethers
and hydrocarbons.
Solubility
Solubility of alcohols and phenols in
water is due to their ability to form
hydrogen bonds with water molecules
as shown. The solubility decreases with
increase in size of alkyl/aryl (hydrophobic) groups. Several of the lower
molecular mass alcohols are miscible
with water in all proportions.

boiling points:

Chemical
Reactions

Alcohols are versatile compounds. They react both as nucleophiles and
electrophiles. The bond between O–H is broken when alcohols react as
nucleophiles.

Based on the cleavage of O–H and C–O bonds, the reactions
of alcohols and phenols may be divided into two groups:

(a) Reactions involving cleavage of O–H bond
1. Acidity of alcohols and phenols

(i) Reaction with metals: Alcohols and phenols react with active
metals such as sodium, potassium and aluminium to yield
corresponding alkoxides/phenoxides and hydrogen.

In addition to this, phenols react with aqueous sodium
hydroxide to form sodium phenoxides.

+ H 2O

The above reactions show that alcohols and phenols are
acidic in nature. In fact, alcohols and phenols are Brönsted
acids i.e., they can donate a proton to a stronger base (B:).

(ii) Acidity of alcohols: The acidic character of alcohols is due to
the polar nature of O–H bond. An electron-releasing group
(–CH3, –C2H5) increases electron density on oxygen tending to
decrease the polarity of O-H bond. This decreases the acid
strength. For this reason, the acid strength of alcohols decreases
in the following order:

Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers

Alcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be
illustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide.

This reaction shows that water is a better proton donor (i.e.,
stronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note
that an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide
ion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases (sodium
ethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide).
Alcohols act as Bronsted bases as well. It is due to the
presence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen, which makes
them proton acceptors.
(iii) Acidity of phenols: The reactions of phenol with metals (e.g.,
sodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic
nature. The hydroxyl group, in phenol is directly attached to
2
the sp hybridised carbon of benzene ring which acts as an
electron withdrawing group. Due to this, the charge distribution
in phenol molecule, as depicted in its resonance structures,
causes the oxygen of –OH group to be positive.

The reaction of phenol with aqueous sodium hydroxide
indicates that phenols are stronger acids than alcohols and water.
Let us examine how a compound in which hydroxyl group
attached to an aromatic ring is more acidic than the one in
which hydroxyl group is attached to an alkyl group.
The ionisation of an alcohol and a phenol takes place as follows:

2

Due to the higher electronegativity of sp hybridised carbon
of phenol to which –OH is attached, electron density decreases
on oxygen. This increases the polarity of O–H bond and results
in an increase in ionisation of phenols than that of alcohols.
Now let us examine the stabilities of alkoxide and phenoxide
ions. In alkoxide ion, the negative charge is localised on oxygen
while in phenoxide ion, the charge is delocalised.
The delocalisation of negative charge (structures I-V) makes
Chemistry 206

Rationalised 2023-24

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

phenoxide ion more stable and favours the ionisation of phenol.
Although there is also charge delocalisation in phenol, its
resonance structures have charge separation due to which the
phenol molecule is less stable than phenoxide ion.

In substituted phenols, the presence of electron withdrawing
groups such as nitro group, enhances the acidic strength of
phenol. This effect is more pronounced when such a group is
present at ortho and para positions. It is due to the effective
delocalisation of negative charge in phenoxide ion when
substituent is at ortho or para position. On the other hand,
electron releasing groups, such as alkyl groups, in general, do
not favour the formation of phenoxide ion resulting in decrease
in acid strength. Cresols, for example, are less acidic than phenol.
The greater the pKa
value, the weaker the
acid.

The reaction with carboxylic acid and acid anhydride is carried

the presence of a base (pyridine) so as to neutralise HCl which is

phenols is known as acetylation. Acetylation of salicylic acid

The reactions involving cleavage of C–O bond take place only in
alcohols. Phenols show this type of reaction only with zinc.
1. Reaction with hydrogen halides: Alcohols react with hydrogen
halides to form alkyl halides (Refer Unit 6, Class XII).
ROH + HX ® R–X + H2O
The difference in reactivity of three classes of alcohols with HCl
distinguishes them from one another (Lucas test). Alcohols are soluble
in Lucas reagent (conc. HCl and ZnCl2) while their halides are immiscible
and produce turbidity in solution. In case of tertiary alcohols, turbidity
is produced immediately as they form the halides easily. Primary
alcohols do not produce turbidity at room temperature.
2. Reaction with phosphorus trihalides: Alcohols are converted to
alkyl bromides by reaction with phosphorus tribromide (Refer
Unit 6, Class XII).
3. Dehydration: Alcohols undergo dehydration (removal of a molecule
of water) to form alkenes on treating with a protic acid e.g.,
concentrated H2SO4 or H3PO4, or catalysts such as anhydrous zinc
chloride or alumina.

Ethanol undergoes dehydration by heating it with concentrated
H2SO4 at 443 K.

Secondary and tertiary alcohols are dehydrated under milder
conditions. For example

Thus, the relative ease of dehydration of alcohols follows the
following order:
Tertiary

>

Secondary

>

Primary

The mechanism of dehydration of ethanol involves the following steps:
Tertiary carbocations
are more stable and
therefore are easier to
form than secondary
and primary
carbocations; tertiary
alcohols are the easiest
to dehydrate.

Mechanism

Step 1: Formation of protonated alcohol.

Step 2: Formation of carbocation: It is the slowest step and hence, the
rate determining step of the reaction.

Step 3: Formation of ethene by elimination of a proton.

The acid used in step 1 is released in step 3. To drive the equilibrium
to the right, ethene is removed as it is formed.
4. Oxidation: Oxidation of alcohols involves the formation of a carbonoxygen double bond with cleavage of an O-H and C-H bonds.

Such a cleavage and formation of bonds occur in oxidation
reactions. These are also known as dehydrogenation reactions as
these involve loss of dihydrogen from an alcohol molecule. Depending
on the oxidising agent used, a primary alcohol is oxidised to an
aldehyde which in turn is oxidised to a carboxylic acid.

Secondary alcohols are oxidised to ketones by chromic anhyride
(CrO3).

Tertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation reaction. Under strong
reaction conditions such as strong oxidising agents (KMnO4) and
elevated temperatures, cleavage of various C-C bonds takes place
and a mixture of carboxylic
acids containing lesser number
of carbon atoms is formed.
When the vapours of a
primary or a secondary alcohol
are passed over heated copper
at 573 K, dehydrogenation
takes place and an aldehyde or
a ketone is formed while tertiary
alcohols undergo dehydration.

Biological oxidation of methanol and ethanol in the body produces the corresponding
aldehyde followed by the acid. At times the alcoholics, by mistake, drink ethanol,
mixed with methanol also called denatured alcohol. In the body, methanol is oxidised
first to methanal and then to methanoic acid, which may cause blindness and
death. A methanol poisoned patient is treated by giving intravenous infusions of
diluted ethanol. The enzyme responsible for oxidation of aldehyde (HCHO) to acid
is swamped allowing time for kidneys to excrete methanol.

1. Electrophilic aromatic substitution
In phenols, the reactions that take place on the aromatic ring are
electrophilic substitution reactions (Unit 9, Class XI). The –OH group
attached to the benzene ring activates it towards electrophilic
substitution. Also, it directs the incoming group to ortho and para
positions in the ring as these positions become electron rich due to
the resonance effect caused by –OH group. The resonance structures
are shown under acidity of phenols.
Common electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions taking place
in phenol are as follows:
(i) Nitration: With dilute nitric acid at low temperature (298 K),
phenol yields a mixture of ortho and para nitrophenols.

The ortho and para isomers can be separated by steam
distillation. o-Nitrophenol is steam volatile due to intramolecular
hydrogen bonding while p-nitrophenol is less volatile due to
intermolecular hydrogen bonding which causes the association
of molecules.

2, 4, 6 - Trinitrophenol
is a strong acid due to
the presence of three
electron withdrawing
–NO2 groups which
facilitate the release of
hydrogen ion.

With concentrated nitric acid, phenol is converted to
2,4,6-trinitrophenol. The product is commonly known as picric
acid. The yield of the reaction product is poor.

Nowadays picric acid is prepared by treating phenol first
with concentrated sulphuric acid which converts it to
phenol-2,4-disulphonic acid, and then with concentrated nitric
acid to get 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. Can you write the equations of

products are formed under different experimental conditions.
(a) When the reaction is carried out in solvents of low polarity
such as CHCl 3 or CS 2 and at low temperature,
monobromophenols are formed.

The usual halogenation of benzene takes place in the
presence of a Lewis acid, such as FeBr3 (Unit 6, Class XII),
which polarises the halogen molecule. In case of phenol, the
polarisation of bromine molecule takes place even in the
absence of Lewis acid. It is due to the highly activating
effect of –OH group attached to the benzene ring.
(b) When phenol is treated with bromine water,
2,4,6-tribromophenol is formed as white precipitate.

position of the incoming group.

is even more reactive than phenol towards electrophilic aromatic
substitution. Hence, it undergoes electrophilic substitution with

7.5 Some
Commercially
Important
Alcohols

Methanol and ethanol are among the two commercially important
alcohols.
1. Methanol
Methanol, CH3OH, also known as ‘wood spirit’, was produced by
destructive distillation of wood. Today, most of the methanol is
produced by catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide at high
pressure and temperature and in the presence of ZnO – Cr2O3
catalyst.

Methanol is a colourless liquid and boils at 337 K. It is highly
poisonous in nature. Ingestion of even small quantities of methanol
can cause blindness and large quantities causes even death. Methanol
is used as a solvent in paints, varnishes and chiefly for making
formaldehyde.
2. Ethanol
Ethanol, C2H5OH, is obtained commercially by fermentation, the
oldest method is from sugars. The sugar in molasses, sugarcane
or fruits such as grapes is converted to glucose and fructose, (both
of which have the formula C6H12O6), in the presence of an enzyme,
invertase. Glucose and fructose undergo fermentation in the
presence of another enzyme, zymase, which is found in yeast.

Ingestion of ethanol acts
on the central nervous
system. In moderate
amounts, it affects
judgment and lowers
inhibitions. Higher
concentrations cause
nausea and loss of
consciousness. Even at
higher concentrations,
it interferes with
spontaneous respiration
and can be fatal.

In wine making, grapes are the source of sugars and yeast. As
grapes ripen, the quantity of sugar increases and yeast grows on the
outer skin. When grapes are crushed, sugar and the enzyme come in
contact and fermentation starts. Fermentation takes place in
anaerobic conditions i.e. in absence of air. Carbon dioxide is released
during fermentation.
The action of zymase is inhibited once the percentage of alcohol
formed exceeds 14 percent. If air gets into fermentation mixture, the
oxygen of air oxidises ethanol to ethanoic acid which in turn destroys
the taste of alcoholic drinks.
Ethanol is a colourless liquid with boiling point 351 K. It is used
as a solvent in paint industry and in the preparation of a number of
carbon compounds. The commercial alcohol is made unfit for drinking
by mixing in it some copper sulphate (to give it a colour) and pyridine
(a foul smelling liquid). It is known as denaturation of alcohol.
Nowadays, large quantities of ethanol are obtained by hydration of
ethene (Section 7.4).

7.6 Ethers
7.6.1

Preparation
of Ethers

Diethyl ether has been
used widely as an
inhalation anaesthetic.
But due to its slow
effect and an
unpleasant recovery
period, it has been
replaced, as an
anaesthetic, by other
compounds.

1. By dehydration of alcohols
Alcohols undergo dehydration in the presence of protic acids
(H2SO4, H3PO4). The formation of the reaction product, alkene or ether
depends on the reaction conditions. For example, ethanol is
dehydrated to ethene in the presence of sulphuric acid at 443 K.
At 413 K, ethoxyethane is the main product.

The formation of ether is a nucleophilic bimolecular reaction (SN2)
involving the attack of alcohol molecule on a protonated alcohol, as
indicated below:

Acidic dehydration of alcohols, to give an alkene is also associated
with substitution reaction to give an ether.
The method is suitable for the preparation of ethers having
primary alkyl groups only. The alkyl group should be unhindered
and the temperature be kept low. Otherwise the reaction favours the
formation of alkene. The reaction follows SN1 pathway when the alcohol
is secondary or tertiary about which you will learn in higher classes.
However, the dehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols to give
corresponding ethers is unsuccessful as elimination competes over
substitution and as a consequence, alkenes are easily formed.
Can you explain why is bimolecular dehydration not appropriate
for the preparation of ethyl methyl ether?

Williamson (1824–1904)
was born in London of
Scottish parents. In
1849, he became

O Na + CH3–Br

Better results are obtained if the alkyl halide is primary. In case
of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides, elimination competes over
substitution. If a tertiary alkyl halide is used, an alkene is the only
reaction product and no ether is formed. For example, the reaction of
CH3ONa with (CH3)3C–Br gives exclusively 2-methylpropene.

It is because alkoxides are not only nucleophiles but strong bases
as well. They react with alkyl halides leading to elimination reactions.

Example 7.6 The following is not an appropriate reaction for the preparation of
t-butyl ethyl ether.

(i) What would be the major product of this reaction ?
(ii) Write a suitable reaction for the preparation of t-butylethyl ether.

Solution

(i) The major product of the given reaction is 2-methylprop-1-ene.
It is because sodium ethoxide is a strong nucleophile as well as
a strong base. Thus elimination reaction predominates over
substitution.

(ii)

Phenols are also converted to ethers by this method. In this, phenol
is used as the phenoxide moiety.

Physical
Properties

The C-O bonds in ethers are polar and thus, ethers have a net dipole
moment. The weak polarity of ethers do not appreciably affect their

The large difference in boiling points of alcohols and ethers is due
to the presence of hydrogen bonding in alcohols.
The miscibility of ethers with water resembles those of alcohols of
the same molecular mass. Both ethoxyethane and butan-1-ol are
miscible to almost the same extent i.e., 7.5 and 9 g per 100 mL water,
respectively while pentane is essentially immiscible with water. Can
you explain this observation ? This is due to the fact that just like
alcohols, oxygen of ether can also form hydrogen bonds with water
molecule as shown:

7.6.3

Chemical
Reactions

1. Cleavage of C–O bond in ethers
Ethers are the least reactive of the functional groups. The cleavage of
C-O bond in ethers takes place under drastic conditions with excess
of hydrogen halides. The reaction of dialkyl ether gives two alkyl
halide molecules.

Alkyl aryl ethers are cleaved at the alkyl-oxygen bond due to the
more stable aryl-oxygen bond. The reaction yields phenol and alkyl
halide.

Ethers with two different alkyl groups are also cleaved in the same
manner.
The order of reactivity of hydrogen halides is as follows:
HI > HBr > HCl. The cleavage of ethers takes place with concentrated
HI or HBr at high temperature.

Mechanism
The reaction of an ether with concentrated HI starts with protonation of ether molecule.
Step 1:

The reaction takes place with HBr or HI because these reagents are sufficiently acidic.
Step 2:
Iodide is a good nucleophile. It attacks the least substituted carbon of the oxonium
ion formed in step 1 and displaces an alcohol molecule by SN2 mechanism.
Thus, in the cleavage of mixed ethers with two different alkyl groups, the alcohol
and alkyl iodide formed, depend on the nature of alkyl groups. When primary or
secondary alkyl groups are present, it is the lower alkyl group that forms alkyl
iodide (SN2 reaction).

When HI is in excess and the reaction is carried out at high temperature,
ethanol reacts with another molecule of HI and is converted to ethyl iodide.
Step 3:

However, when one of the alkyl group is a tertiary group, the halide
formed is a tertiary halide.

Summary
Alcohols and phenols are classified (i) on the basis of the number of hydroxyl
3
2
groups and (ii) according to the hybridisation of the carbon atom, sp or sp to
which the –OH group is attached. Ethers are classified on the basis of groups
attached to the oxygen atom.
Alcohols may be prepared (1) by hydration of alkenes (i) in presence of an
acid and (ii) by hydroboration-oxidation reaction (2) from carbonyl compounds by
(i) catalytic reduction and (ii) the action of Grignard reagents. Phenols may be
prepared by (1) substitution of (i) halogen atom in haloarenes and (ii) sulphonic
acid group in aryl sulphonic acids, by –OH group (2) by hydrolysis of diazonium
salts and (3) industrially from cumene.
Alcohols are higher boiling than other classes of compounds, namely
hydrocarbons, ethers and haloalkanes of comparable molecular masses. The
ability of alcohols, phenols and ethers to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding
with water makes them soluble in it.
Alcohols and phenols are acidic in nature. Electron withdrawing groups in
phenol increase its acidic strength and electron releasing groups decrease it.
Alcohols undergo nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen halides to yield
alkyl halides. Dehydration of alcohols gives alkenes. On oxidation, primary alcohols
yield aldehydes with mild oxidising agents and carboxylic acids with strong
oxidising agents while secondary alcohols yield ketones. Tertiary alcohols are
resistant to oxidation.
The presence of –OH group in phenols activates the aromatic ring towards
electrophilic substitution and directs the incoming group to ortho and para
positions due to resonance effect. Reimer-Tiemann reaction of phenol yields
salicylaldehyde. In presence of sodium hydroxide, phenol generates phenoxide
ion which is even more reactive than phenol. Thus, in alkaline medium, phenol
undergoes Kolbe’s reaction.
Ethers may be prepared by (i) dehydration of alcohols and (ii) Williamson
synthesis. The boiling points of ethers resemble those of alkanes while their
solubility is comparable to those of alcohols having same molecular mass. The
C–O bond in ethers can be cleaved by hydrogen halides. In electrophilic
substitution, the alkoxy group activates the aromatic ring and directs the incoming
group to ortho and para positions.

Objectives
After studying this Unit, you will be

ethers according to the IUPAC
system of nomenclature;
• discuss the reactions involved in
the preparation of alcohols from
alkenes, aldehydes, ketones and
carboxylic acids;

haloarenes, benzene sulphonic
acids, diazonium salts and
cumene;

the
reactions
for

Alcohols
Alcohols,, Phenols
and Ether
therss
Alcohols, phenols and ethers are the basic compounds for the
formation of detergents, antiseptics and fragrances, respectively.

You have learnt that substitution of one or more
hydrogen atom(s) from a hydrocarbon by another atom
or a group of atoms result in the formation of an entirely
new compound having altogether different properties
and applications. Alcohols and phenols are formed
when a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon, aliphatic and
aromatic respectively, is replaced by –OH group. These
classes of compounds find wide applications in industry
as well as in day-to-day life. For instance, have you
ever noticed that ordinary spirit used for polishing
wooden furniture is chiefly a compound containing
hydroxyl group, ethanol. The sugar we eat, the cotton
used for fabrics, the paper we use for writing, are all
made up of compounds containing –OH groups. Just
think of life without paper; no note-books, books, newspapers, currency notes, cheques, certificates, etc. The
magazines carrying beautiful photographs and
interesting stories would disappear from our life. It
would have been really a different world.
An alcohol contains one or more hydroxyl (OH)
group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s), of an
aliphatic system (CH3OH) while a phenol contains –OH
group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s) of an
aromatic system (C6H5OH).
The substitution of a hydrogen atom in a
hydrocarbon by an alkoxy or aryloxy group
(R–O/Ar–O) yields another class of compounds known
as ‘ethers’, for example, CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether). You
may also visualise ethers as compounds formed by

substituting the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of an alcohol or
phenol by an alkyl or aryl group.
In this unit, we shall discuss the chemistry of three classes of
compounds, namely — alcohols, phenols and ethers.

7.1 Classification

7.1.1

Alcohols—
Mono, Di,
Tri or
Polyhydric
alcohols

The classification of compounds makes their study systematic and
hence simpler. Therefore, let us first learn how are alcohols, phenols
and ethers classified?
Alcohols and phenols may be classified as mono–, di–, tri- or
polyhydric compounds depending on whether they contain one, two,
three or many hydroxyl groups respectively in their structures as
given below:

Monohydric

Trihydric

Dihydric

Monohydric alcohols may be further classified according to the
hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is
attached.
(i) Compounds containing Csp 3  OH bond: In this class of alcohols,
3

the –OH group is attached to an sp hybridised carbon atom of an
alkyl group. They are further classified as follows:
Primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols: In these three types of
alcohols, the –OH group is attached to primary, secondary and
tertiary carbon atom, respectively as depicted below:

Allylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached to
3
a sp hybridised carbon adjacent to the carbon-carbon double
bond, that is to an allylic carbon. For example

Benzylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached
3
to a sp —hybridised carbon atom next to an aromatic ring. For
example.

Allylic and benzylic alcohols may be primary, secondary or tertiary.
(ii) Compounds containing Csp 2  OH bond: These alcohols contain
—OH group bonded to a carbon-carbon double bond, i.e., to a
vinylic carbon or to an aryl carbon. These alcohols are also known
as vinylic alcohols.
Vinylic alcohol: CH2 = CH – OH

Phenols—
Mono, Di
and
trihydric
phenols
Monohydric

7.1.3

Ethers are classified as simple or symmetrical, if the alkyl or aryl
groups attached to the oxygen atom are the same, and mixed or
unsymmetrical, if the two groups are different. Diethyl ether,
C2H5OC2H5, is a symmetrical ether whereas C2H5OCH3 and C2H5OC6H5
are unsymmetrical ethers.

According to IUPAC system, the name of an alcohol is derived from the
name of the alkane from which the alcohol is derived, by substituting ‘e’
of alkane with the suffix ‘ol’. The position of substituents are indicated
by numerals. For this, the longest carbon chain (parent chain) is
numbered starting at the end nearest to the hydroxyl group. The positions
of the –OH group and other substituents are indicated by using the
numbers of carbon atoms to which these are attached. For naming
polyhydric alcohols, the ‘e’ of alkane is retained and the ending ‘ol’ is
added. The number of –OH groups is indicated by adding the
multiplicative prefix, di, tri, etc., before ‘ol’. The positions of –OH groups
are indicated by appropriate locants, e.g., HO–CH2–CH2–OH is named as
ethane–1, 2-diol. Table 7.1 gives common and IUPAC names of a few
alcohols as examples.

of phenol involves a benzene ring, in its substituted compounds the
terms ortho (1,2- disubstituted), meta (1,3-disubstituted) and para
(1,4-disubstituted) are often used in the common names.

If both the alkyl groups are the same, the prefix ‘di’ is added before the alkyl
group. For example, C2H5OC2H5 is diethyl ether.
According to IUPAC system of nomenclature, ethers are regarded as
hydrocarbon derivatives in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by an
–OR or –OAr group, where R and Ar represent alkyl and aryl groups,
respectively. The larger (R) group is chosen as the parent hydrocarbon.
The names of a few ethers are given as examples in Table 7.2.

The bond angle

in alcohols is slightly less than the tetrahedral

angle (109°-28¢). It is due to the repulsion between the unshared
electron pairs of oxygen. In phenols, the –OH group is attached to sp2
hybridised carbon of an aromatic ring. The carbon– oxygen bond
length (136 pm) in phenol is slightly less than that in methanol. This
is due to (i) partial double bond character on account of the conjugation
of unshared electron pair of oxygen with the aromatic ring
2
(Section 7.4.4) and (ii) sp hybridised state of carbon to which oxygen
is attached.
In ethers, the four electron pairs, i.e., the two bond pairs and two
lone pairs of electrons on oxygen are arranged approximately in a
tetrahedral arrangement. The bond angle is slightly greater than the
tetrahedral angle due to the repulsive interaction between the two
bulky (–R) groups. The C–O bond length (141 pm) is almost the same
as in alcohols.

7.4 Alcohols and
Phenols

7.4.1 Preparation of Alcohols
Alcohols are prepared by the following methods:
1. From alkenes
(i) By acid catalysed hydration: Alkenes react with water in the
presence of acid as catalyst to form alcohols. In case of
unsymmetrical alkenes, the addition reaction takes place in
accordance with Markovnikov’s rule.

Mechanism
The mechanism of the reaction involves the following three steps:
Step 1: Protonation of alkene to form carbocation by electrophilic
+
attack of H3O .
+
+
H2O + H ® H3O

Step 2: Nucleophilic attack of water on carbocation.

Step 3: Deprotonation to form an alcohol.

Hydroboration oxidation was first
reported by H.C.
Brown in 1959. For
his studies on boron
containing organic
compounds, Brown
shared the 1979 Nobel
prize in Chemistry
with G. Wittig.

(ii) By hydroboration–oxidation: Diborane (BH3)2 reacts with alkenes
to give trialkyl boranes as addition product. This is oxidised to
alcohol by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aqueous sodium
hydroxide.

The addition of borane to the double bond takes place in such
2
a manner that the boron atom gets attached to the sp carbon
carrying greater number of hydrogen atoms. The alcohol so formed
looks as if it has been formed by the addition of water to the
alkene in a way opposite to the Markovnikov’s rule. In this reaction,
alcohol is obtained in excellent yield.
2. From carbonyl compounds
(i) By reduction of aldehydes and ketones: Aldehydes and ketones
are reduced to the corresponding alcohols by addition of
hydrogen in the presence of catalysts (catalytic hydrogenation).
The usual catalyst is a finely divided metal such as platinum,
palladium or nickel. It is also prepared by treating aldehydes
and ketones with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or lithium
aluminium hydride (LiAlH4). Aldehydes yield primary alcohols
whereas ketones give secondary alcohols.

The numbers in front
of the reagents along
the arrow indicate
that the second
reagent is added only
when the reaction
with first is complete.

(ii) By reduction of carboxylic acids and esters: Carboxylic acids
are reduced to primary alcohols in excellent yields by lithium
aluminium hydride, a strong reducing agent.
(i) LiAlH4

RCOOH
(ii) H2O

RCH2OH

However, LiAlH4 is an expensive reagent, and therefore, used
for preparing special chemicals only. Commercially, acids are
reduced to alcohols by converting them to the esters (Section
7.4.4), followed by their reduction using hydrogen in the
presence of catalyst (catalytic hydrogenation).

3. From Grignard reagents
Alcohols are produced by the reaction of Grignard reagents (Unit 6,
Class XII) with aldehydes and ketones.
The first step of the reaction is the nucleophilic addition of Grignard
reagent to the carbonyl group to form an adduct. Hydrolysis of the
adduct yields an alcohol.

alcohols.

Chlorobenzene is fused with NaOH at 623K and 320 atmospheric
pressure. Phenol is obtained by acidification of sodium phenoxide so
produced (Unit 6, Class XII).

2. From benzenesulphonic acid
Benzene is sulphonated with oleum and benzene sulphonic acid so
formed is converted to sodium phenoxide on heating with molten
sodium hydroxide. Acidification of the sodium salt gives phenol.

3. From diazonium salts
A diazonium salt is formed by treating an aromatic primary amine
with nitrous acid (NaNO2 + HCl) at 273-278 K. Diazonium salts are
hydrolysed to phenols by warming with water or by treating with
dilute acids (Unit 9, Class XII).

Physical
Properties

Alcohols and phenols consist of two parts, an alkyl/aryl group and a
hydroxyl group. The properties of alcohols and phenols are chiefly due
to the hydroxyl group. The nature of alkyl and aryl groups simply
modify these properties.
Boiling Points
The boiling points of alcohols and phenols increase with increase in the
number of carbon atoms (increase in van der Waals forces). In alcohols,
the boiling points decrease with increase of branching in carbon chain
(because of decrease in van der Waals forces with decrease in surface
area).
The –OH group in alcohols and phenols is involved in intermolecular
hydrogen bonding as shown below:

It is interesting to note that boiling points of alcohols and phenols
are higher in comparison to other classes of compounds, namely
hydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes of comparable
molecular masses. For example, ethanol and propane have comparable
molecular masses but their boiling points differ widely. The boiling
point of methoxymethane is intermediate of the two boiling points.

203

Rationalised 2023-24

Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

The high boiling points of alcohols are mainly due to the presence
of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in them which is lacking in ethers
and hydrocarbons.
Solubility
Solubility of alcohols and phenols in
water is due to their ability to form
hydrogen bonds with water molecules
as shown. The solubility decreases with
increase in size of alkyl/aryl (hydrophobic) groups. Several of the lower
molecular mass alcohols are miscible
with water in all proportions.

Chemical
Reactions

Alcohols are versatile compounds. They react both as nucleophiles and
electrophiles. The bond between O–H is broken when alcohols react as
nucleophiles.

Protonated alcohols as electrophiles

Based on the cleavage of O–H and C–O bonds, the reactions
of alcohols and phenols may be divided into two groups:

(a) Reactions involving cleavage of O–H bond
1. Acidity of alcohols and phenols

(i) Reaction with metals: Alcohols and phenols react with active
metals such as sodium, potassium and aluminium to yield
corresponding alkoxides/phenoxides and hydrogen.

In addition to this, phenols react with aqueous sodium
hydroxide to form sodium phenoxides.

+ H 2O
Sodium phenoxide

The above reactions show that alcohols and phenols are
acidic in nature. In fact, alcohols and phenols are Brönsted
acids i.e., they can donate a proton to a stronger base (B:).

(ii) Acidity of alcohols: The acidic character of alcohols is due to
the polar nature of O–H bond. An electron-releasing group
(–CH3, –C2H5) increases electron density on oxygen tending to
decrease the polarity of O-H bond. This decreases the acid
strength. For this reason, the acid strength of alcohols decreases
in the following order:

Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers

Alcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be
illustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide.

This reaction shows that water is a better proton donor (i.e.,
stronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note
that an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide
ion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases (sodium
ethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide).
Alcohols act as Bronsted bases as well. It is due to the
presence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen, which makes
them proton acceptors.
(iii) Acidity of phenols: The reactions of phenol with metals (e.g.,
sodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic
nature. The hydroxyl group, in phenol is directly attached to
2
the sp hybridised carbon of benzene ring which acts as an
electron withdrawing group. Due to this, the charge distribution
in phenol molecule, as depicted in its resonance structures,
causes the oxygen of –OH group to be positive.

The reaction of phenol with aqueous sodium hydroxide
indicates that phenols are stronger acids than alcohols and water.
Let us examine how a compound in which hydroxyl group
attached to an aromatic ring is more acidic than the one in
which hydroxyl group is attached to an alkyl group.
The ionisation of an alcohol and a phenol takes place as follows:

2

Due to the higher electronegativity of sp hybridised carbon
of phenol to which –OH is attached, electron density decreases
on oxygen. This increases the polarity of O–H bond and results
in an increase in ionisation of phenols than that of alcohols.
Now let us examine the stabilities of alkoxide and phenoxide
ions. In alkoxide ion, the negative charge is localised on oxygen
while in phenoxide ion, the charge is delocalised.
The delocalisation of negative charge (structures I-V) makes
Chemistry 206

Rationalised 2023-24

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

phenoxide ion more stable and favours the ionisation of phenol.
Although there is also charge delocalisation in phenol, its
resonance structures have charge separation due to which the
phenol molecule is less stable than phenoxide ion.

In substituted phenols, the presence of electron withdrawing
groups such as nitro group, enhances the acidic strength of
phenol. This effect is more pronounced when such a group is
present at ortho and para positions. It is due to the effective
delocalisation of negative charge in phenoxide ion when
substituent is at ortho or para position. On the other hand,
electron releasing groups, such as alkyl groups, in general, do
not favour the formation of phenoxide ion resulting in decrease
in acid strength. Cresols, for example, are less acidic than phenol.
The greater the pKa
value, the weaker the
acid.

The reaction with carboxylic acid and acid anhydride is carried
out in the presence of a small amount of concentrated sulphuric

soon as it is formed. The reaction with acid chloride is carried out in
the presence of a base (pyridine) so as to neutralise HCl which is
formed during the reaction. It shifts the equilibrium to the right
hand side. The introduction of acetyl (CH3CO) group in alcohols or
phenols is known as acetylation. Acetylation of salicylic acid
produces aspirin.

(b) Reactions involving cleavage of carbon – oxygen (C–O) bond in

The reactions involving cleavage of C–O bond take place only in
alcohols. Phenols show this type of reaction only with zinc.
1. Reaction with hydrogen halides: Alcohols react with hydrogen
halides to form alkyl halides (Refer Unit 6, Class XII).
ROH + HX ® R–X + H2O
The difference in reactivity of three classes of alcohols with HCl
distinguishes them from one another (Lucas test). Alcohols are soluble
in Lucas reagent (conc. HCl and ZnCl2) while their halides are immiscible
and produce turbidity in solution. In case of tertiary alcohols, turbidity
is produced immediately as they form the halides easily. Primary
alcohols do not produce turbidity at room temperature.
2. Reaction with phosphorus trihalides: Alcohols are converted to
alkyl bromides by reaction with phosphorus tribromide (Refer
Unit 6, Class XII).
3. Dehydration: Alcohols undergo dehydration (removal of a molecule
of water) to form alkenes on treating with a protic acid e.g.,
concentrated H2SO4 or H3PO4, or catalysts such as anhydrous zinc
chloride or alumina.

Ethanol undergoes dehydration by heating it with concentrated
H2SO4 at 443 K.

Secondary and tertiary alcohols are dehydrated under milder
conditions. For example

Thus, the relative ease of dehydration of alcohols follows the
following order:
Tertiary

>

Secondary

>

Primary

The mechanism of dehydration of ethanol involves the following steps:
Tertiary carbocations
are more stable and
therefore are easier to
form than secondary
and primary
carbocations; tertiary
alcohols are the easiest
to dehydrate.

Mechanism

Step 1: Formation of protonated alcohol.

Step 2: Formation of carbocation: It is the slowest step and hence, the
rate determining step of the reaction.

Step 3: Formation of ethene by elimination of a proton.

The acid used in step 1 is released in step 3. To drive the equilibrium
to the right, ethene is removed as it is formed.
4. Oxidation: Oxidation of alcohols involves the formation of a carbonoxygen double bond with cleavage of an O-H and C-H bonds.

Such a cleavage and formation of bonds occur in oxidation
reactions. These are also known as dehydrogenation reactions as
these involve loss of dihydrogen from an alcohol molecule. Depending
on the oxidising agent used, a primary alcohol is oxidised to an
aldehyde which in turn is oxidised to a carboxylic acid.

Secondary alcohols are oxidised to ketones by chromic anhyride
(CrO3).

Tertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation reaction. Under strong
reaction conditions such as strong oxidising agents (KMnO4) and
elevated temperatures, cleavage of various C-C bonds takes place
and a mixture of carboxylic
acids containing lesser number
of carbon atoms is formed.
When the vapours of a
primary or a secondary alcohol
are passed over heated copper
at 573 K, dehydrogenation
takes place and an aldehyde or
a ketone is formed while tertiary
alcohols undergo dehydration.

Biological oxidation of methanol and ethanol in the body produces the corresponding
aldehyde followed by the acid. At times the alcoholics, by mistake, drink ethanol,
mixed with methanol also called denatured alcohol. In the body, methanol is oxidised
first to methanal and then to methanoic acid, which may cause blindness and
death. A methanol poisoned patient is treated by giving intravenous infusions of
diluted ethanol. The enzyme responsible for oxidation of aldehyde (HCHO) to acid
is swamped allowing time for kidneys to excrete methanol.

1. Electrophilic aromatic substitution
In phenols, the reactions that take place on the aromatic ring are
electrophilic substitution reactions (Unit 9, Class XI). The –OH group
attached to the benzene ring activates it towards electrophilic
substitution. Also, it directs the incoming group to ortho and para
positions in the ring as these positions become electron rich due to
the resonance effect caused by –OH group. The resonance structures
are shown under acidity of phenols.
Common electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions taking place
in phenol are as follows:
(i) Nitration: With dilute nitric acid at low temperature (298 K),
phenol yields a mixture of ortho and para nitrophenols.

The ortho and para isomers can be separated by steam
distillation. o-Nitrophenol is steam volatile due to intramolecular
hydrogen bonding while p-nitrophenol is less volatile due to
intermolecular hydrogen bonding which causes the association
of molecules.

2, 4, 6 - Trinitrophenol
is a strong acid due to
the presence of three
electron withdrawing
–NO2 groups which
facilitate the release of
hydrogen ion.

With concentrated nitric acid, phenol is converted to
2,4,6-trinitrophenol. The product is commonly known as picric
acid. The yield of the reaction product is poor.

Nowadays picric acid is prepared by treating phenol first
with concentrated sulphuric acid which converts it to
phenol-2,4-disulphonic acid, and then with concentrated nitric
acid to get 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. Can you write the equations of

(ii) Halogenation: On treating phenol with bromine, different reaction
products are formed under different experimental conditions.
(a) When the reaction is carried out in solvents of low polarity
such as CHCl 3 or CS 2 and at low temperature,
monobromophenols are formed.

The usual halogenation of benzene takes place in the
presence of a Lewis acid, such as FeBr3 (Unit 6, Class XII),
which polarises the halogen molecule. In case of phenol, the
polarisation of bromine molecule takes place even in the
absence of Lewis acid. It is due to the highly activating
effect of –OH group attached to the benzene ring.
(b) When phenol is treated with bromine water,
2,4,6-tribromophenol is formed as white precipitate.

position of the incoming group.

2. Kolbe’s reaction

is even more reactive than phenol towards electrophilic aromatic
substitution. Hence, it undergoes electrophilic substitution with

7.5 Some
Commercially
Important
Alcohols

Methanol and ethanol are among the two commercially important
alcohols.
1. Methanol
Methanol, CH3OH, also known as ‘wood spirit’, was produced by
destructive distillation of wood. Today, most of the methanol is
produced by catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide at high
pressure and temperature and in the presence of ZnO – Cr2O3
catalyst.

Methanol is a colourless liquid and boils at 337 K. It is highly
poisonous in nature. Ingestion of even small quantities of methanol
can cause blindness and large quantities causes even death. Methanol
is used as a solvent in paints, varnishes and chiefly for making
formaldehyde.
2. Ethanol
Ethanol, C2H5OH, is obtained commercially by fermentation, the
oldest method is from sugars. The sugar in molasses, sugarcane
or fruits such as grapes is converted to glucose and fructose, (both
of which have the formula C6H12O6), in the presence of an enzyme,
invertase. Glucose and fructose undergo fermentation in the
presence of another enzyme, zymase, which is found in yeast.

Ingestion of ethanol acts
on the central nervous
system. In moderate
amounts, it affects
judgment and lowers
inhibitions. Higher
concentrations cause
nausea and loss of
consciousness. Even at
higher concentrations,
it interferes with
spontaneous respiration
and can be fatal.

In wine making, grapes are the source of sugars and yeast. As
grapes ripen, the quantity of sugar increases and yeast grows on the
outer skin. When grapes are crushed, sugar and the enzyme come in
contact and fermentation starts. Fermentation takes place in
anaerobic conditions i.e. in absence of air. Carbon dioxide is released
during fermentation.
The action of zymase is inhibited once the percentage of alcohol
formed exceeds 14 percent. If air gets into fermentation mixture, the
oxygen of air oxidises ethanol to ethanoic acid which in turn destroys
the taste of alcoholic drinks.
Ethanol is a colourless liquid with boiling point 351 K. It is used
as a solvent in paint industry and in the preparation of a number of
carbon compounds. The commercial alcohol is made unfit for drinking
by mixing in it some copper sulphate (to give it a colour) and pyridine
(a foul smelling liquid). It is known as denaturation of alcohol.
Nowadays, large quantities of ethanol are obtained by hydration of
ethene (Section 7.4).

7.6 Ethers
7.6.1

Preparation
of Ethers

Diethyl ether has been
used widely as an
inhalation anaesthetic.
But due to its slow
effect and an
unpleasant recovery
period, it has been
replaced, as an
anaesthetic, by other
compounds.

1. By dehydration of alcohols
Alcohols undergo dehydration in the presence of protic acids
(H2SO4, H3PO4). The formation of the reaction product, alkene or ether
depends on the reaction conditions. For example, ethanol is
dehydrated to ethene in the presence of sulphuric acid at 443 K.
At 413 K, ethoxyethane is the main product.

The formation of ether is a nucleophilic bimolecular reaction (SN2)
involving the attack of alcohol molecule on a protonated alcohol, as
indicated below:

Acidic dehydration of alcohols, to give an alkene is also associated
with substitution reaction to give an ether.
The method is suitable for the preparation of ethers having
primary alkyl groups only. The alkyl group should be unhindered
and the temperature be kept low. Otherwise the reaction favours the
formation of alkene. The reaction follows SN1 pathway when the alcohol
is secondary or tertiary about which you will learn in higher classes.
However, the dehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols to give
corresponding ethers is unsuccessful as elimination competes over
substitution and as a consequence, alkenes are easily formed.
Can you explain why is bimolecular dehydration not appropriate
for the preparation of ethyl methyl ether?

Alexander William
Williamson (1824–1904)
was born in London of
Scottish parents. In
1849, he became
Professor of Chemistry
at University College,
London.

O Na + CH3–Br

Better results are obtained if the alkyl halide is primary. In case
of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides, elimination competes over
substitution. If a tertiary alkyl halide is used, an alkene is the only
reaction product and no ether is formed. For example, the reaction of
CH3ONa with (CH3)3C–Br gives exclusively 2-methylpropene.

It is because alkoxides are not only nucleophiles but strong bases
as well. They react with alkyl halides leading to elimination reactions.

Example 7.6 The following is not an appropriate reaction for the preparation of
t-butyl ethyl ether.

(i) What would be the major product of this reaction ?
(ii) Write a suitable reaction for the preparation of t-butylethyl ether.

Solution

(i) The major product of the given reaction is 2-methylprop-1-ene.
It is because sodium ethoxide is a strong nucleophile as well as
a strong base. Thus elimination reaction predominates over
substitution.

(ii)

Phenols are also converted to ethers by this method. In this, phenol
is used as the phenoxide moiety.

Physical
Properties

The C-O bonds in ethers are polar and thus, ethers have a net dipole
moment. The weak polarity of ethers do not appreciably affect their
boiling points which are comparable to those of the alkanes of

points of alcohols as shown in the following cases:

The large difference in boiling points of alcohols and ethers is due
to the presence of hydrogen bonding in alcohols.
The miscibility of ethers with water resembles those of alcohols of
the same molecular mass. Both ethoxyethane and butan-1-ol are
miscible to almost the same extent i.e., 7.5 and 9 g per 100 mL water,
respectively while pentane is essentially immiscible with water. Can
you explain this observation ? This is due to the fact that just like
alcohols, oxygen of ether can also form hydrogen bonds with water
molecule as shown:

7.6.3

Chemical
Reactions

1. Cleavage of C–O bond in ethers
Ethers are the least reactive of the functional groups. The cleavage of
C-O bond in ethers takes place under drastic conditions with excess
of hydrogen halides. The reaction of dialkyl ether gives two alkyl
halide molecules.

Alkyl aryl ethers are cleaved at the alkyl-oxygen bond due to the
more stable aryl-oxygen bond. The reaction yields phenol and alkyl
halide.

Ethers with two different alkyl groups are also cleaved in the same
manner.
The order of reactivity of hydrogen halides is as follows:
HI > HBr > HCl. The cleavage of ethers takes place with concentrated
HI or HBr at high temperature.

Mechanism
The reaction of an ether with concentrated HI starts with protonation of ether molecule.
Step 1:

The reaction takes place with HBr or HI because these reagents are sufficiently acidic.
Step 2:
Iodide is a good nucleophile. It attacks the least substituted carbon of the oxonium
ion formed in step 1 and displaces an alcohol molecule by SN2 mechanism.
Thus, in the cleavage of mixed ethers with two different alkyl groups, the alcohol
and alkyl iodide formed, depend on the nature of alkyl groups. When primary or
secondary alkyl groups are present, it is the lower alkyl group that forms alkyl
iodide (SN2 reaction).

When HI is in excess and the reaction is carried out at high temperature,
ethanol reacts with another molecule of HI and is converted to ethyl iodide.
Step 3:

However, when one of the alkyl group is a tertiary group, the halide
formed is a tertiary halide.

Summary
Alcohols and phenols are classified (i) on the basis of the number of hydroxyl
3
2
groups and (ii) according to the hybridisation of the carbon atom, sp or sp to
which the –OH group is attached. Ethers are classified on the basis of groups
attached to the oxygen atom.
Alcohols may be prepared (1) by hydration of alkenes (i) in presence of an
acid and (ii) by hydroboration-oxidation reaction (2) from carbonyl compounds by
(i) catalytic reduction and (ii) the action of Grignard reagents. Phenols may be
prepared by (1) substitution of (i) halogen atom in haloarenes and (ii) sulphonic
acid group in aryl sulphonic acids, by –OH group (2) by hydrolysis of diazonium
salts and (3) industrially from cumene.
Alcohols are higher boiling than other classes of compounds, namely
hydrocarbons, ethers and haloalkanes of comparable molecular masses. The
ability of alcohols, phenols and ethers to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding
with water makes them soluble in it.
Alcohols and phenols are acidic in nature. Electron withdrawing groups in
phenol increase its acidic strength and electron releasing groups decrease it.
Alcohols undergo nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen halides to yield
alkyl halides. Dehydration of alcohols gives alkenes. On oxidation, primary alcohols
yield aldehydes with mild oxidising agents and carboxylic acids with strong
oxidising agents while secondary alcohols yield ketones. Tertiary alcohols are
resistant to oxidation.
The presence of –OH group in phenols activates the aromatic ring towards
electrophilic substitution and directs the incoming group to ortho and para
positions due to resonance effect. Reimer-Tiemann reaction of phenol yields
salicylaldehyde. In presence of sodium hydroxide, phenol generates phenoxide
ion which is even more reactive than phenol. Thus, in alkaline medium, phenol
undergoes Kolbe’s reaction.
Ethers may be prepared by (i) dehydration of alcohols and (ii) Williamson
synthesis. The boiling points of ethers resemble those of alkanes while their
solubility is comparable to those of alcohols having same molecular mass. The
C–O bond in ethers can be cleaved by hydrogen halides. In electrophilic
substitution, the alkoxy group activates the aromatic ring and directs the incoming
group to ortho and para positions.

Aldehydes
Aldehydes,, Ke tones
and Carboxylic
A cids
Carbonyl compounds are of utmost importance to organic
chemistry. They are constituents of fabrics, flavourings, plastics
and drugs.

In the previous Unit, you have studied organic
compounds with functional groups containing carbonoxygen single bond. In this Unit, we will study about the
organic compounds containing carbon-oxygen double
bond (>C=O) called carbonyl group, which is one of the
most important functional groups in organic chemistry.
In aldehydes, the carbonyl group is bonded to a
carbon and hydrogen while in the ketones, it is bonded
to two carbon atoms. The carbonyl compounds in which
carbon of carbonyl group is bonded to carbon or
hydrogen and oxygen of hydroxyl moiety (-OH) are
known as carboxylic acids, while in compounds where
carbon is attached to carbon or hydrogen and nitrogen
of -NH2 moiety or to halogens are called amides and
acyl halides respectively. Esters and anhydrides are
derivatives of carboxylic acids. The general formulas of
these classes of compounds are given below:

Aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids are widespread in plants
and animal kingdom. They play an important role in biochemical
processes of life. They add fragrance and flavour to nature, for example,
vanillin (from vanilla beans), salicylaldehyde (from meadow sweet) and
cinnamaldehyde (from cinnamon) have very pleasant fragrances.

They are used in many food products and pharmaceuticals to add
flavours. Some of these families are manufactured for use as solvents
(i.e., acetone) and for preparing materials like adhesives, paints, resins,
perfumes, plastics, fabrics, etc.

8.1 Nomenclature and Structure of Carbonyl Group
8.1.1
Nomenclature

I.

Aldehydes and ketones
Aldehydes and ketones are the simplest and most important carbonyl
compounds.
There are two systems of nomenclature of aldehydes and ketones.
(a) Common names
Aldehydes and ketones are often called by their common names
instead of IUPAC names. The common names of most aldehydes are
derived from the common names of the corresponding carboxylic
acids [Section 8.6.1] by replacing the ending –ic of acid with aldehyde.
At the same time, the names reflect the Latin or Greek term for the
original source of the acid or aldehyde. The location of the substituent
in the carbon chain is indicated by Greek letters a, b, g, d, etc. The
a-carbon being the one directly linked to the aldehyde group, bcarbon the next, and so on. For example

Chemistry 228

Rationalised 2023-24

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

The common names of ketones are derived by naming two alkyl
or aryl groups bonded to the carbonyl group. The locations of
substituents are indicated by Greek letters, a a¢, b b¢ and so on
beginning with the carbon atoms next to the carbonyl group,
indicated as aa¢. Some ketones have historical common names,
the simplest dimethyl ketone is called acetone. Alkyl phenyl
ketones are usually named by adding the name of acyl group as
prefix to the word phenone. For example

(b) IUPAC names
The IUPAC names of open chain aliphatic aldehydes and ketones
are derived from the names of the corresponding alkanes by
replacing the ending –e with –al and –one respectively. In case of
aldehydes the longest carbon chain is numbered starting from the
carbon of the aldehyde group while in case of ketones the
numbering begins from the end nearer to the carbonyl group. The
substituents are prefixed in alphabetical order along with numerals
indicating their positions in the carbon chain. The same applies to
cyclic ketones, where the carbonyl carbon is numbered one. When
the aldehyde group is attached to a ring, the suffix carbaldehyde
is added after the full name of the cycloalkane. The numbering of
the ring carbon atoms start from the carbon atom attached to the
aldehyde group. The name of the simplest aromatic aldehyde
carrying the aldehyde group on a benzene ring is
benzenecarbaldehyde. However, the common name benzaldehyde
is also accepted by IUPAC. Other aromatic aldehydes are hence
named as substituted benzaldehydes.

8.1.2 Structure of
the
Carbonyl
Group

2

The carbonyl carbon atom is sp -hybridised and forms three sigma (s)
bonds. The fourth valence electron of carbon remains in its p-orbital
and forms a p-bond with oxygen by overlap with p-orbital of an oxygen.
In addition, the oxygen atom also has two non bonding electron pairs.
Thus, the carbonyl carbon and the three atoms attached to it lie in the
same plane and the p-electron cloud is above and below this plane. The
bond angles are approximately 120° as expected of a trigonal coplanar
structure (Figure 8.1).

π

Fig.8.1 Orbital diagram for the formation of carbonyl group

The carbon-oxygen double bond is polarised due to higher
electronegativity of oxygen relative to carbon. Hence, the carbonyl
carbon is an electrophilic (Lewis acid), and carbonyl
oxygen, a nucleophilic (Lewis base) centre. Carbonyl
compounds have substantial dipole moments and are
polar than ethers. The high polarity of the carbonyl group
is explained on the basis of resonance involving a neutral
(A) and a dipolar (B) structures as shown.

8.2 Preparation of Aldehydes Some important methods for the preparation of aldehydes
and ketones are as follows:
and Ketones
8.2.1

Preparation
of
Aldehydes
and
Ketones

1. By oxidation of alcohols
Aldehydes and ketones are generally prepared by oxidation of primary
and secondary alcohols, respectively (Unit 7, Class XII).
2. By dehydrogenation of alcohols
This method is suitable for volatile alcohols and is of industrial
application. In this method alcohol vapours are passed over heavy
metal catalysts (Ag or Cu). Primary and secondary alcohols give
aldehydes and ketones, respectively (Unit 7, Class XII).
3. From hydrocarbons
(i) By ozonolysis of alkenes: As we know, ozonolysis of alkenes
followed by reaction with zinc dust and water gives aldehydes,

ketones or a mixture of both depending on the substitution
pattern of the alkene (Unit 9, Class XI).
(ii) By hydration of alkynes: Addition of water to ethyne in the
presence of H2SO4 and HgSO4 gives acetaldehyde. All other
alkynes give ketones in this reaction (Unit 9, Class XI).
8.2.2

Preparation
of
Aldehydes

1. From acyl chloride (acid chloride)
Acyl chloride (acid chloride) is hydrogenated over catalyst, palladium
on barium sulphate. This reaction is called Rosenmund reduction.

2. From nitriles and esters
Nitriles are reduced to corresponding imine with stannous chloride
in the presence of hydrochloric acid, which on hydrolysis give
corresponding aldehyde.

This reaction is called Stephen reaction.
Alternatively,
nitriles
are
selectively
reduced
by
diisobutylaluminium hydride, (DIBAL-H) to imines followed by
hydrolysis to aldehydes:

Similarly, esters are also reduced to aldehydes with DIBAL-H.

3. From hydrocarbons
Aromatic aldehydes (benzaldehyde and its derivatives) are prepared
from aromatic hydrocarbons by the following methods:
(i) By oxidation of methylbenzene
Strong oxidising agents oxidise toluene and its derivatives to
benzoic acids. However, it is possible to stop the oxidation at
the aldehyde stage with suitable reagents that convert the methyl
group to an intermediate that is difficult to oxidise further. The
following methods are used for this purpose.
(a) Use of chromyl chloride (CrO2Cl2): Chromyl chloride oxidises
methyl group to a chromium complex, which on hydrolysis
gives corresponding benzaldehyde.
Chemistry 232

Rationalised 2023-24

This reaction is called Etard reaction.
(b) Use of chromic oxide (CrO3): Toluene or substituted toluene
is converted to benzylidene diacetate on treating with chromic
oxide in acetic anhydride. The benzylidene diacetate can be
hydrolysed to corresponding benzaldehyde with aqueous acid.

(ii) By side chain chlorination followed by hydrolysis
Side chain chlorination of toluene gives benzal chloride, which
on hydrolysis gives benzaldehyde. This is a commercial method
of manufacture of benzaldehyde.

(iii) By Gatterman – Koch reaction
When benzene or its derivative is treated with carbon monoxide
and hydrogen chloride in the presence of anhydrous aluminium
chloride or cuprous chloride, it gives benzaldehyde or substituted
benzaldehyde.

This reaction is known as Gatterman-Koch reaction.
8.2.3

Preparation
of Ketones

1. From acyl chlorides
Treatment of acyl chlorides with dialkylcadmium, prepared by the
reaction of cadmium chloride with Grignard reagent, gives ketones.

8.3 Physical
Properties

The physical properties of aldehydes and ketones are described as
follows.
Methanal is a gas at room temperature. Ethanal is a volatile liquid.
Other aldehydes and ketones are liquid or solid at room temperature.
The boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are higher than
hydrocarbons and ethers of comparable molecular masses. It is due to
weak molecular association in aldehydes and ketones arising out of the
dipole-dipole interactions. Also, their boiling points are lower than those
of alcohols of similar molecular masses due to absence of intermolecular
hydrogen bonding. The following compounds of molecular masses 58
and 60 are ranked in order of increasing boiling points.

Propanal
Acetone
Propan-1-ol

The lower members of aldehydes and ketones such as methanal,
ethanal and propanone are miscible with water in all proportions,
because they form hydrogen bond with water.

However, the solubility of aldehydes and ketones decreases rapidly
on increasing the length of alkyl chain. All aldehydes and ketones are
fairly soluble in organic solvents like benzene, ether, methanol,
chloroform, etc. The lower aldehydes have sharp pungent odours. As
the size of the molecule increases, the odour becomes less pungent
and more fragrant. In fact, many naturally occurring aldehydes and
ketones are used in the blending of perfumes and flavouring agents.
Arrange the following compounds in the increasing order of their
boiling points:
CH3CH2CH2CHO, CH3CH2CH2CH2OH, H5C2-O-C2H5, CH3CH2CH2CH3

Example 8.2

The molecular masses of these compounds are in the range of 72 to
74. Since only butan-1-ol molecules are associated due to extensive
intermolecular hydrogen bonding, therefore, the boiling point of
butan-1-ol would be the highest. Butanal is more polar than
ethoxyethane. Therefore, the intermolecular dipole-dipole attraction
is stronger in the former. n-Pentane molecules have only weak van
der Waals forces. Hence increasing order of boiling points of the
given compounds is as follows:

Solution

CH3CH2CH2CH3 < H5C2-O-C2H5 < CH3CH2CH2CHO < CH3CH2CH2CH2OH

8.4 Chemical
Reactions

Arrange the following compounds in increasing order of
their boiling points.

Since aldehydes and ketones both possess the carbonyl functional
group, they undergo similar chemical reactions.
1. Nucleophilic addition reactions
Contrary to electrophilic addition reactions observed in alkenes, the
aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions.
(i) Mechanism of nucleophilic addition reactions
A nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the polar
carbonyl group from a direction approximately perpendicular
2
to the plane of sp hybridised orbitals of carbonyl carbon (Fig.
2
3
8.2). The hybridisation of carbon changes from sp to sp in
this process, and a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate is
produced. This intermediate captures a proton from the
reaction medium to give
the electrically neutral
product. The net result is
–
+
addition of Nu and H
across the carbon oxygen
double bond as shown in
Fig. 8.2.

Fig.8.2: Nucleophilic attack on carbonyl carbon

(ii) Reactivity
Aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones in
nucleophilic addition reactions due to steric and electronic
reasons. Sterically, the presence of two relatively large
substituents in ketones hinders the approach of nucleophile to
carbonyl carbon than in aldehydes having only one such
substituent. Electronically, aldehydes are more reactive than
ketones because two alkyl groups reduce the electrophilicity of
the carbonyl carbon more effectively than in former.

Example 8.3 Would you expect benzaldehyde to be more reactive or less reactive in
nucleophilic addition reactions than propanal? Explain your answer.

Solution The carbon atom of the carbonyl group of benzaldehyde is less
electrophilic than carbon atom of the carbonyl group present in
propanal. The polarity of the carbonyl
group is reduced in benzaldehyde due
to resonance as shown below and
hence it is less reactive than propanal.

(iii) Some important examples of nucleophilic addition and
nucleophilic addition-elimination reactions:
(a) Addition of hydrogen cyanide (HCN): Aldehydes
and ketones react with hydrogen cyanide (HCN)
to yield cyanohydrins. This reaction occurs very
slowly with pure HCN. Therefore, it is catalysed
by a base and the generated cyanide ion (CN )
being a stronger nucleophile readily adds to
carbonyl compounds to yield corresponding
cyanohydrin.
Cyanohydrins
are
useful
synthetic
intermediates.
(b) Addition of sodium hydrogensulphite: Sodium
hydrogensulphite adds to aldehydes and
ketones to form the addition products.
The position of
the equilibrium
lies largely to
the right hand
side for most
aldehydes and to
the left for most
ketones due to steric reasons. The hydrogensulphite addition
compound is water soluble and can be converted back to the
original carbonyl compound by treating it with dilute mineral
acid or alkali. Therefore, these are useful for separation and
purification of aldehydes.
(c) Addition of Grignard reagents: (refer Unit 7, Class XII).
(d) Addition of alcohols: Aldehydes react with one equivalent of
monohydric alcohol in the presence of dry hydrogen chloride
to yield alkoxyalcohol intermediate, known as hemiacetals,
which further react with one more molecule of alcohol to
give a gem-dialkoxy
compound known as
acetal as shown in the
reaction.
Ketones react with
ethylene glycol under
similar conditions to form
cyclic products known as
ethylene glycol ketals.
Dry hydrogen chloride
protonates the oxygen of
the carbonyl compounds
and therefore, increases
the electrophilicity of the
carbonyl carbon facilitating

the nucleophilic attack of ethylene glycol. Acetals and ketals
are hydrolysed with aqueous mineral acids to yield
corresponding aldehydes and ketones respectively.
(e) Addition of ammonia and its derivatives: Nucleophiles, such
as ammonia and its derivatives H2N-Z add to the carbonyl
group of aldehydes and ketones. The reaction is reversible
and catalysed by acid.

equilibrium
favours the product
formation due to rapid
dehydration of the
intermediate to form

primary and secondary alcohols respectively by sodium
borohydride (NaBH4) or lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) as
well as by catalytic hydrogenation (Unit 7, Class XII).
(ii) Reduction to hydrocarbons: The carbonyl group of aldehydes

reduction] or with hydrazine followed by heating with sodium
or potassium hydroxide in high boiling solvent such as ethylene
glycol (Wolff-Kishner reduction).

3. Oxidation
Bernhard Tollens
(1841-1918) was a
Professor of Chemistry
at the University of
Gottingen, Germany.

Aldehydes differ from ketones in their oxidation reactions. Aldehydes
are easily oxidised to carboxylic acids on treatment with common
oxidising agents like nitric acid, potassium permanganate, potassium
dichromate, etc. Even mild oxidising agents, mainly Tollens’ reagent
and Fehlings’ reagent also oxidise aldehydes.

Ketones are generally oxidised under vigorous conditions, i.e.,
strong oxidising agents and at elevated temperatures. Their oxidation
involves carbon-carbon bond cleavage to afford a mixture of carboxylic
acids having lesser number of carbon atoms than the parent ketone.

The mild oxidising agents given below are used to distinguish
aldehydes from ketones:
(i) Tollens’ test: On warming an aldehyde with freshly prepared
ammoniacal silver nitrate solution (Tollens’ reagent), a bright
silver mirror is produced due to the formation of silver metal.
The aldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion.
The reaction occurs in alkaline medium.

(ii) Fehling’s test: Fehling reagent comprises of two solutions,
Fehling solution A and Fehling solution B. Fehling solution A is
aqueous copper sulphate and Fehling solution B is alkaline
sodium potassium tartarate (Rochelle salt). These two solutions

(iii) Oxidation of methyl ketones by haloform reaction:
Aldehydes and ketones having at least one methyl group
linked to the carbonyl carbon atom (methyl ketones)
are oxidised by sodium hypohalite to sodium salts of
corresponding carboxylic
acids having one carbon
atom less than that of
carbonyl compound. The
methyl
group
is
converted to haloform.
This oxidation does not
affect a carbon-carbon
double bond, if present
in the molecule.
Iodoform reaction with sodium hypoiodite is also used for detection
of CH3CO group or CH3CH(OH) group which produces CH3CO group
on oxidation.

Example 8.4

An organic compound (A) with molecular formula C8H8O forms an
orange-red precipitate with 2,4-DNP reagent and gives yellow
precipitate on heating with iodine in the presence of sodium
hydroxide. It neither reduces Tollens’ or Fehlings’ reagent, nor does
it decolourise bromine water or Baeyer’s reagent. On drastic oxidation
with chromic acid, it gives a carboxylic acid (B) having molecular
formula C7H6O2. Identify the compounds (A) and (B) and explain the
reactions involved.

Solution (A) forms 2,4-DNP derivative. Therefore, it is an aldehyde or a ketone.
Since it does not reduce Tollens’ or Fehling reagent, (A) must be a ketone.
(A) responds to iodoform test. Therefore, it should be a methyl ketone.
The molecular formula of (A) indicates high degree of unsaturation, yet
it does not decolourise bromine water or Baeyer’s reagent. This indicates
the presence of unsaturation due to an aromatic ring.
Compound (B), being an oxidation product of a ketone should be a
carboxylic acid. The molecular formula of (B) indicates that it should
be benzoic acid and compound (A) should, therefore, be a
monosubstituted aromatic methyl ketone. The molecular formula of
(A) indicates that it should be phenyl methyl ketone (acetophenone).

4. Reactions due to a-hydrogen
Acidity of a-hydrogens of aldehydes and ketones: The aldehydes
and ketones undergo a number of reactions due to the acidic nature
of a-hydrogen.
The acidity of a-hydrogen atoms of carbonyl compounds is due
to the strong electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group and
resonance stabilisation of the conjugate base.

(i) Aldol condensation: Aldehydes and ketones having at least one
a-hydrogen undergo a reaction in the presence of dilute alkali
as catalyst to form b-hydroxy aldehydes (aldol) or b-hydroxy
ketones (ketol), respectively. This is known as Aldol reaction.

The name aldol is derived from the names of the two
functional groups, aldehyde and alcohol, present in the products.
The aldol and ketol readily lose water to give a,b-unsaturated
carbonyl compounds which are aldol condensation products
and the reaction is called Aldol condensation. Though ketones
give ketols (compounds containing a keto and alcohol groups),
the general name aldol condensation still applies to the reactions
of ketones due to their similarity with aldehydes.

(ii) Cross aldol condensation: When aldol condensation is carried
out between two different aldehydes and / or ketones, it is called
cross aldol condensation. If both of them contain a-hydrogen
atoms, it gives a mixture of four products. This is illustrated
below by aldol reaction of a mixture of ethanal and propanal.

Ketones can also be used as one component in the cross aldol
reactions.

5. Other reactions
(i) Cannizzaro reaction: Aldehydes which do not have an
a-hydrogen atom, undergo self oxidation and reduction
(disproportionation) reaction on heating with concentrated alkali.
In this reaction, one molecule of the aldehyde is reduced to
alcohol while another is oxidised to carboxylic acid salt.

8 . 5 Uses of
Aldehydes
and Ketones

In chemical industry aldehydes and ketones are used as solvents,
starting materials and reagents for the synthesis of other products.
Formaldehyde is well known as formalin (40%) solution used to preserve
biological specimens and to prepare bakelite (a phenol-formaldehyde
resin), urea-formaldehyde glues and other polymeric products.
Acetaldehyde is used primarily as a starting material in the manufacture
of acetic acid, ethyl acetate, vinyl acetate, polymers and drugs.
Benzaldehyde is used in perfumery and in dye industries. Acetone and
ethyl methyl ketone are common industrial solvents. Many aldehydes
and ketones, e.g., butyraldehyde, vanillin, acetophenone, camphor, etc.
are well known for their odours and flavours.

Carboxylic Acids
Carbon compounds containing a carboxyl functional group, –COOH are
called carboxylic acids. The carboxyl group, consists of a carbonyl group
attached to a hydroxyl group, hence its name carboxyl. Carboxylic acids
may be aliphatic (RCOOH) or aromatic (ArCOOH) depending on the group,
alkyl or aryl, attached to carboxylic carbon. Large number of carboxylic
acids are found in nature. Some higher members of aliphatic carboxylic
acids (C12 – C18) known as fatty acids, occur in natural fats as esters of
glycerol. Carboxylic acids serve as starting material for several other
important organic compounds such as anhydrides, esters, acid chlorides,
amides, etc.

8 . 6 Nomenclature and Structure of Carboxyl Group
8.6.1
Nomenclature

Since carboxylic acids are amongst the earliest organic compounds to
be isolated from nature, a large number of them are known by their
common names. The common names end with the suffix –ic acid and
have been derived from Latin or Greek names of their natural sources.
For example, formic acid (HCOOH) was first obtained from red ants
(Latin: formica means ant), acetic acid (CH3COOH) from vinegar (Latin:
acetum, means vinegar), butyric acid (CH3CH2CH2COOH) from rancid
butter (Latin: butyrum, means butter).
In the IUPAC system, aliphatic carboxylic acids are named by
replacing the ending –e in the name of the corresponding alkane with –
oic acid. In numbering the carbon chain, the carboxylic carbon is
numbered one. For naming compounds containing more than one
carboxyl group, the alkyl chain leaving carboxyl groups is numbered
and the number of carboxyl groups is indicated by adding the
multiplicative prefix, dicarboxylic acid, tricarboxylic acid, etc. to the name
of parent alkyl chain. The position of –COOH groups are indicated by the
arabic numeral before the multiplicative prefix. Some of the carboxylic
acids along with their common and IUPAC names are listed in Table 8.3.

Acids

Some important methods of preparation of carboxylic acids are as follows.
1. From primary alcohols and aldehydes
Primary alcohols are readily oxidised to carboxylic acids with common
oxidising agents such as potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in
neutral, acidic or alkaline media or by potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7)
and chromium trioxide (CrO3) in acidic media (Jones reagent).

Carboxylic acids are also prepared from aldehydes by the use of
mild oxidising agents (Section 8.4).
2. From alkylbenzenes
Aromatic carboxylic acids can be prepared by vigorous oxidation of
alkyl benzenes with chromic acid or acidic or alkaline potassium
permanganate. The entire side chain is oxidised to the carboxyl group
irrespective of length of the side chain. Primary and secondary alkyl
groups are oxidised in this manner while tertiary group is not affected.
Suitably substituted alkenes are also oxidised to carboxylic acids
with these oxidising reagents.

3. From nitriles and amides
Nitriles are hydrolysed to amides and then to acids in the presence of
+



H or OH as catalyst. Mild reaction conditions are used to stop the
reaction at the amide stage.

4. From Grignard reagents
Grignard reagents react with carbon dioxide (dry ice) to form salts of
carboxylic acids which in turn give corresponding carboxylic acids
after acidification with mineral acid.

As we know, the Grignard reagents and nitriles can be prepared
from alkyl halides (refer Unit 6, Class XII). The above methods

(3 and 4) are useful for converting alkyl halides into corresponding
carboxylic acids having one carbon atom more than that present in
alkyl halides (ascending the series).
5. From acyl halides and anhydrides
Acid chlorides when hydrolysed with water give carboxylic acids or more
readily hydrolysed with aqueous base to give carboxylate ions which on
acidification provide corresponding carboxylic acids. Anhydrides on the
other hand are hydrolysed to corresponding acid(s) with water.

6. From esters
Acidic hydrolysis of esters gives directly carboxylic acids while basic
hydrolysis gives carboxylates, which on acidification give
corresponding carboxylic acids.

8.8 Physical
Properties

Aliphatic carboxylic acids upto nine carbon atoms are colourless
liquids at room temperature with unpleasant odours. The higher
acids are wax like solids and are practically odourless due
to their low volatility. Carboxylic acids are higher boiling
liquids than aldehydes, ketones and even alcohols of
comparable molecular masses. This is due to more extensive
association of carboxylic acid molecules through
intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonds are
not broken completely even in the vapour phase. In fact,
In vapour state or in
most carboxylic acids exist as dimer in the vapour phase
aprotic solvent
or in the aprotic solvents.
Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids having upto four
carbon atoms are miscible in water due to the formation
of hydrogen bonds with water. The solubility decreases
with increasing number of carbon atoms. Higher
carboxylic acids are practically insoluble in water due to
the increased hydrophobic interaction of hydrocarbon
part. Benzoic acid, the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid
is nearly insoluble in cold water. Carboxylic acids are
Hydrogen bonding of
also soluble in less polar organic solvents like benzene,
RCOOH with H2O
ether, alcohol, chloroform, etc.

The reaction of carboxylic acids are classified as follows:

Acidity
Reactions with metals and alkalies

The carboxylic acids like alcohols evolve hydrogen with electropositive
metals and form salts with alkalies similar to phenols. However, unlike
phenols they react with weaker bases such as carbonates and
hydrogencarbonates to evolve carbon dioxide. This reaction is used to
detect the presence of carboxyl group in an organic compound.

Carboxylic acids dissociate in water to give resonance stabilised
carboxylate anions and hydronium ion.

For the above reaction:

where Keq, is equilibrium constant and Ka is the acid dissociation
constant.
For convenience, the strength of an acid is generally indicated by
its pKa value rather than its Ka value.
pKa = – log Ka
The pKa of hydrochloric acid is –7.0, where as pKa of trifluoroacetic
acid (the strongest carboxylic acid), benzoic acid and acetic acid are
0.23, 4.19 and 4.76, respectively.
Smaller the pKa, the stronger the acid ( the better it is as a proton
donor). Strong acids have pKa values < 1, the acids with pKa values
between 1 and 5 are considered to be moderately strong acids, weak
acids have pKa values between 5 and 15, and extremely weak acids
have pKa values >15.
Carboxylic acids are weaker than mineral acids, but they are stronger
acids than alcohols and many simple phenols (pKa is ~16 for ethanol
and 10 for phenol). In fact, carboxylic acids are amongst the most acidic
organic compounds you have studied so far. You already know why
phenols are more acidic than alcohols. The higher acidity of carboxylic
acids as compared to phenols can be understood similarly. The conjugate
base of carboxylic acid, a carboxylate ion, is stabilised by two equivalent
resonance structures in which the negative charge is at the more
electronegative oxygen atom. The conjugate base of phenol, a phenoxide
ion, has non-equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge
is at the less electronegative carbon atom. Therefore, resonance in
phenoxide ion is not as important as it is in carboxylate ion. Further, the
negative charge is delocalised over two electronegative oxygen atoms in
carboxylate ion whereas it is less effectively delocalised over one oxygen
atom and less electronegative carbon atoms in phenoxide ion (Unit 7,
Class XII). Thus, the carboxylate ion is more stabilised than phenoxide
ion, so carboxylic acids are more acidic than phenols.
Effect of substituents on the acidity of carboxylic acids:
Substituents may affect the stability of the conjugate base and thus,
also affect the acidity of the carboxylic acids. Electron withdrawing
groups increase the acidity of carboxylic acids by stabilising the
conjugate base through delocalisation of the negative charge by
inductive and/or resonance effects. Conversely, electron donating groups
decrease the acidity by destabilising the conjugate base.

stabilises the carboxylate anion
and strengthens the acid

The effect of the following groups in increasing acidity order is
Ph < I < Br < Cl < F < CN < NO2 < CF3
Thus, the following acids are arranged in order of increasing acidity
(based on pKa values):
CF3COOH > CCl3COOH > CHCl2COOH > NO2CH2COOH > NC-CH2COOH >
FCH2COOH > ClCH2COOH > BrCH2COOH > HCOOH > ClCH2CH2COOH >
(continue)
C6H5COOH > C6H5CH2COOH > CH3COOH > CH3CH2COOH
(continue )
Direct attachment of groups such as phenyl or vinyl to the carboxylic
acid, increases the acidity of corresponding carboxylic acid, contrary to
the decrease expected due to resonance effect shown below:

2

This is because of greater electronegativity of sp hybridised carbon
to which carboxyl carbon is attached. The presence of electron
withdrawing group on the phenyl of aromatic carboxylic acid increases
their acidity while electron donating groups decrease their acidity.

Mechanism of esterification of carboxylic acids: The esterification of carboxylic
acids with alcohols is a kind of nucleophilic acyl substitution. Protonation of the
carbonyl oxygen activates the carbonyl group towards nucleophilic addition of the
alcohol. Proton transfer in the tetrahedral intermediate converts the hydroxyl group
+
into – OH2 group, which, being a better leaving group, is eliminated as neutral water
molecule. The protonated ester so formed finally loses a proton to give the ester.

3. Reactions with PCl5, PCl3 and SOCl2
The hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids, behaves like that of alcohols
and is easily replaced by chlorine atom on treating with PCl5, PCl3 or
SOCl2. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is preferred because the other two
products are gaseous and escape the reaction mixture making the
purification of the products easier.

4. Reaction with ammonia
Carboxylic acids react with ammonia to give ammonium salt which
on further heating at high temperature give amides. For example:

2. Decarboxylation
Carboxylic acids lose carbon dioxide to form hydrocarbons when their
sodium salts are heated with sodalime (NaOH and CaO in the ratio of
3 : 1). The reaction is known as decarboxylation.

Alkali metal salts of carboxylic acids also undergo decarboxylation
on electrolysis of their aqueous solutions and form hydrocarbons having
twice the number of carbon atoms present in the alkyl group of the acid.
The reaction is known as Kolbe electrolysis (Unit 9, Class XI).

2. Ring substitution
Aromatic carboxylic acids undergo electrophilic substitution reactions
in which the carboxyl group acts as a deactivating and meta-directing
group. They however, do not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction

aluminium chloride (Lewis acid) gets bonded to the carboxyl group).

Acids

Methanoic acid is used in rubber, textile, dyeing, leather and electroplating
industries. Ethanoic acid is used as solvent and as vinegar in food industry.
Hexanedioic acid is used in the manufacture of nylon-6, 6. Esters of benzoic
acid are used in perfumery. Sodium benzoate is used as a food preservative.
Higher fatty acids are used for the manufacture of soaps and detergents.

Summary
Aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids are some of the important classes of
organic compounds containing carbonyl group. These are highly polar molecules.
Therefore, they boil at higher temperatures than the hydrocarbons and weakly
polar compounds such as ethers of comparable molecular masses. The lower
members are more soluble in water because they form hydrogen bonds with water.
The higher members, because of large size of hydrophobic chain of carbon atoms,
are insoluble in water but soluble in common organic solvents. Aldehydes are
prepared by dehydrogenation or controlled oxidation of primary alcohols and
controlled or selective reduction of acyl halides. Aromatic aldehydes may also be
prepared by oxidation of (i) methylbenzene with chromyl chloride or CrO3 in the
presence of acetic anhydride, (ii) formylation of arenes with carbon monoxide and
hydrochloric acid in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride, and (iii) cuprous
chloride or by hydrolysis of benzal chloride. Ketones are prepared by oxidation of
secondary alcohols and hydration of alkynes. Ketones are also prepared by reaction
of acyl chloride with dialkylcadmium. A good method for the preparation of aromatic
ketones is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with acyl chlorides
or anhydrides. Both aldehydes and ketones can be prepared by ozonolysis of alkenes.
Aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions onto the carbonyl
group with a number of nucleophiles such as, HCN, NaHSO3, alcohols (or diols),

ammonia derivatives, and Grignard reagents. The a-hydrogens in aldehydes and
ketones are acidic. Therefore, aldehydes and ketones having at least one a-hydrogen,
undergo Aldol condensation in the presence of a base to give a-hydroxyaldehydes
(aldol) and a-hydroxyketones(ketol), respectively. Aldehydes having no a-hydrogen
undergo Cannizzaro reaction in the presence of concentrated alkali. Aldehydes
and ketones are reduced to alcohols with NaBH4, LiAlH4, or by catalytic hydrogenation.
The carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to a methylene group
by Clemmensen reduction or Wolff-Kishner reduction. Aldehydes are easily
oxidised to carboxylic acids by mild oxidising reagents such as Tollens’ reagent and
Fehling’s reagent. These oxidation reactions are used to distinguish aldehydes from
ketones. Carboxylic acids are prepared by the oxidation of primary alcohols, aldehydes
and alkenes by hydrolysis of nitriles, and by treatment of Grignard reagents with
carbon dioxide. Aromatic carboxylic acids are also prepared by side-chain oxidation
of alkylbenzenes. Carboxylic acids are considerably more acidic than alcohols and
most of simple phenols. Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols with LiAlH4,
or better with diborane in ether solution and also undergo a-halogenation with Cl2
and Br2 in the presence of red phosphorus (Hell-Volhard Zelinsky reaction).
Methanal, ethanal, propanone, benzaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid and benzoic
acid are highly useful compounds in industry.

Amines constitute an important class of organic
compounds derived by replacing one or more hydrogen
atoms of ammonia molecule by alkyl/aryl group(s). In
nature, they occur among proteins, vitamins, alkaloids
and hormones. Synthetic examples include polymers,
dye stuffs and drugs. Two biologically active
compounds, namely adrenaline and ephedrine, both
containing secondary amino group, are used to increase
blood pressure. Novocain, a synthetic amino compound,
is used as an anaesthetic in dentistry. Benadryl, a well
known antihistaminic drug also contains tertiary amino
group. Quaternary ammonium salts are used as
surfactants. Diazonium salts are intermediates in the
preparation of a variety of aromatic compounds
including dyes. In this Unit, you will learn about amines
and diazonium salts.
I. AMINES
Amines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia,
obtained by replacement of one, two or all the three
hydrogen atoms by alkyl and/or aryl groups.
For example:

9.1 Structure of Amines

Like ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and
carries an unshared pair of electrons. Nitrogen orbitals
in amines are therefore, sp3 hybridised and the geometry
of amines is pyramidal. Each of the three sp3 hybridised
orbitals of nitrogen overlap with orbitals of hydrogen or
carbon depending upon the composition of the amines.
The fourth orbital of nitrogen in all amines contains an
unshared pair of electrons. Due to the presence of
unshared pair of electrons, the angle C–N–E, (where E is

C or H) is less than 109.5°; for instance, it is 108o in case of
trimethylamine as shown in Fig. 9.1.

Fig. 9.1 Pyramidal shape of trimethylamine

9.2 Classification

Amines are classified as primary (1o), secondary (2o) and tertiary (3o)
depending upon the number of hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl or
aryl groups in ammonia molecule. If one hydrogen atom of ammonia
is replaced by R or Ar , we get RNH2 or ArNH2, a primary amine (1o).
If two hydrogen atoms of ammonia or one hydrogen atom of R-NH2 are
replaced by another alkyl/aryl(R’) group, what would you get? You
get R-NHR’, secondary amine. The second alkyl/aryl group may be
same or different. Replacement of another hydrogen atom by alkyl/aryl
group leads to the formation of tertiary amine. Amines are said to be
‘simple’ when all the alkyl or aryl groups are the same, and ‘mixed’
when they are different.

9.3

In common system, an aliphatic amine is named by prefixing alkyl
group to amine, i.e., alkylamine as one word (e.g., methylamine). In
secondary and tertiary amines, when two or more groups are the same,
the prefix di or tri is appended before the name of alkyl group. In
IUPAC system, primary amines are named as alkanamines. The name
is derived by replacement of ‘e’ of alkane by the word amine. For
example, CH3NH2 is named as methanamine. In case, more than one
amino group is present at different positions in the parent chain, their
positions are specified by giving numbers to the carbon atoms bearing
–NH2 groups and suitable prefix such as di, tri, etc. is attached to the
amine. The letter ‘e’ of the suffix of the hydrocarbon part is retained. For
example, H2N–CH2–CH2–NH2 is named as ethane-1, 2-diamine.
To name secondary and tertiary amines, we use locant N to designate
substituent attached to a nitrogen atom. For example, CH3 NHCH2CH3 is

named as N-methylethanamine and (CH3CH2)3N is named as N, Ndiethylethanamine. More examples are given in Table 9.1.
In arylamines, –NH2 group is directly attached to the benzene ring.
C6H5NH2 is the simplest example of arylamine. In common system, it
is known as aniline. It is also an accepted IUPAC name. While naming
arylamines according to IUPAC system, suffix ‘e’ of arene is replaced by
‘amine’. Thus in IUPAC system, C6H5–NH2 is named as benzenamine.
Common and IUPAC names of some alkylamines and arylamines are
given in Table 9.1.

9 . 4 Preparation
of Amines

Amines are prepared by the following methods:
1. Reduction of nitro compounds
Nitro compounds are reduced to amines by passing hydrogen gas
in the presence of finely divided nickel, palladium or platinum and
also by reduction with metals in acidic medium. Nitroalkanes can
also be similarly reduced to the corresponding alkanamines.

Reduction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid is preferred because
FeCl2 formed gets hydrolysed to release hydrochloric acid during the
reaction. Thus, only a small amount of hydrochloric acid is required
to initiate the reaction.
2. Ammonolysis of alkyl halides
You have read (Unit 6, Class XII) that the carbon - halogen bond in
alkyl or benzyl halides can be easily cleaved by a nucleophile. Hence,
an alkyl or benzyl halide on reaction with an ethanolic solution of
ammonia undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction in which the
halogen atom is replaced by an amino (–NH2) group. This process of
cleavage of the C–X bond by ammonia molecule is known as
ammonolysis. The reaction is carried out in a sealed tube at 373
K. The primary amine thus obtained behaves as a nucleophile and
can further react with alkyl halide to form secondary and tertiary
amines, and finally quaternary ammonium salt.

The free amine can be obtained from the ammonium salt by treatment
with a strong base:

Ammonolysis has the disadvantage of yielding a mixture of primary,
secondary and tertiary amines and also a quaternary ammonium salt.
However, primary amine is obtained as a major product by taking
large excess of ammonia.
The order of reactivity of halides with amines is RI > RBr >RCl.

Write chemical equations for the following reactions:
(i) Reaction of ethanolic NH3 with C2H5Cl.
(ii) Ammonolysis of benzyl chloride and reaction of amine so formed
with two moles of CH3Cl.

3. Reduction of nitriles
Nitriles on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) or
catalytic hydrogenation produce primary amines. This reaction is
used for ascent of amine series, i.e., for preparation of amines
containing one carbon atom more than the starting amine.

4. Reduction of amides
The amides on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride yield
amines.

5. Gabriel phthalimide synthesis
Gabriel synthesis is used for the preparation of primary amines.
Phthalimide on treatment with ethanolic potassium hydroxide forms
potassium salt of phthalimide which on heating with alkyl halide
followed by alkaline hydrolysis produces the corresponding primary
amine. Aromatic primary amines cannot be prepared by this method
because aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with
the anion formed by phthalimide.

6. Hoffmann bromamide degradation reaction
Hoffmann developed a method for preparation of primary amines by
treating an amide with bromine in an aqueous or ethanolic solution
of sodium hydroxide. In this degradation reaction, migration of an
alkyl or aryl group takes place from carbonyl carbon of the amide
to the nitrogen atom. The amine so formed contains one carbon less
than that present in the amide.

Properties

How will you convert
(i) Benzene into aniline (ii) Benzene into N, N-dimethylaniline
(iii) Cl–(CH2)4–Cl into hexan-1,6-diamine?

The lower aliphatic amines are gases with fishy odour. Primary amines
with three or more carbon atoms are liquid and still higher ones are
solid. Aniline and other arylamines are usually colourless but get
coloured on storage due to atmospheric oxidation.
Lower aliphatic amines are soluble in water because they can form
hydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, solubility decreases
with increase in molar mass of amines due to increase in size of the
hydrophobic alkyl part. Higher amines are essentially insoluble in water.
Considering the electronegativity of nitrogen of amine and oxygen of
alcohol as 3.0 and 3.5 respectively, you can predict the pattern of
solubility of amines and alcohols in water. Out of butan-1-ol and
butan-1-amine, which will be more soluble in water and why? Amines
are soluble in organic solvents like alcohol, ether and benzene. You
may remember that alcohols are more polar than amines and form
stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds than amines.
Primary and secondary amines are engaged in intermolecular
association due to hydrogen bonding between nitrogen of one and
hydrogen of another molecule. This intermolecular association is more
in primary amines than in secondary amines as there are two hydrogen
atoms available for hydrogen bond formation in it. Tertiary amines do
not have intermolecular association due to the absence of hydrogen
atom available for hydrogen bond formation. Therefore, the order of
boiling points of isomeric amines is as follows:

Reactions

Difference in electronegativity between nitrogen and hydrogen atoms and
the presence of unshared pair of electrons over the nitrogen atom makes
amines reactive. The number of hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen

differ in many

reactions. Moreover, amines behave as nucleophiles due to the presence
of unshared electron pair. Some of the reactions of amines are described
below:
1. Basic character of amines
Amines, being basic in nature, react with acids to form salts.

Chemistry 266

Rationalised 2023-24

Amine salts on treatment with a base like NaOH, regenerate the
parent amine.

Amine salts are soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvents
like ether. This reaction is the basis for the separation of amines from
the non basic organic compounds insoluble in water.
The reaction of amines with mineral acids to form ammonium salts
shows that these are basic in nature. Amines have an unshared pair
of electrons on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis base.
Basic character of amines can be better understood in terms of their Kb
and pKb values as explained below:

pKb = –log Kb
Larger the value of Kb or smaller the value of pKb, stronger is the
base. The pKb values of few amines are given in Table 9.3.
pKb value of ammonia is 4.75. Aliphatic amines are stronger bases
than ammonia due to +I effect of alkyl groups leading to high electron
density on the nitrogen atom. Their pKb values lie in the range of 3 to
4.22. On the other hand, aromatic amines are weaker bases than
ammonia due to the electron withdrawing nature of the aryl group.

You may find some discrepancies while trying to interpret the Kb
values of amines on the basis of +I or –I effect of the substituents
present in amines. Besides inductive effect, there are other effects like
solvation effect, steric hinderance, etc., which affect the basic strength
of amines. Just ponder over. You may get the answer in the following
paragraphs.
Structure-basicity relationship of amines
Basicity of amines is related to their structure. Basic character of an
amine depends upon the ease of formation of the cation by accepting
a proton from the acid. The more stable the cation is relative to the
amine, more basic is the amine.
(a) Alkanamines versus ammonia
Let us consider the reaction of an alkanamine and ammonia with
a proton to compare their basicity.

Due to the electron releasing nature of alkyl group, it (R) pushes
electrons towards nitrogen and thus makes the unshared electron
pair more available for sharing with the proton of the acid. Moreover,
the substituted ammonium ion formed from the amine gets stabilised
due to dispersal of the positive charge by the +I effect of the alkyl
group. Hence, alkylamines are stronger bases than ammonia.
Thus, the basic nature of aliphatic amines should increase with
increase in the number of alkyl groups. This trend is followed in
the gaseous phase. The order of basicity of amines in the gaseous
phase follows the expected order: tertiary amine > secondary amine
> primary amine > NH3. The trend is not regular in the aqueous
state as evident by their pKb values given in Table 9.3. In the
aqueous phase, the substituted ammonium cations get stabilised
not only by electron releasing effect of the alkyl group (+I) but also
by solvation with water molecules. The greater the size of the ion,
lesser will be the solvation and the less stabilised is the ion. The
order of stability of ions are as follows:

Decreasing order of extent of H-bonding in water and order of
stability of ions by solvation.
Chemistry 268

Rationalised 2023-24

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

Greater is the stability of the substituted ammonium cation, stronger
should be the corresponding amine as a base. Thus, the order of basicity
of aliphatic amines should be: primary > secondary > tertiary, which
is opposite to the inductive effect based order. Secondly, when the
alkyl group is small, like –CH3 group, there is no steric hindrance to
H-bonding. In case the alkyl group is bigger than CH3 group, there will
be steric hinderance to H-bonding. Therefore, the change of nature of
the alkyl group, e.g., from –CH3 to –C2H5 results in change of the order
of basic strength. Thus, there is a subtle interplay of the inductive
effect, solvation effect and steric hinderance of the alkyl group which
decides the basic strength of alkyl amines in the aqueous state. The
order of basic strength in case of methyl substituted amines and ethyl
substituted amines in aqueous solution is as follows:
(C2H5)2NH > (C2H5)3N > C2H5NH2 > NH3
(CH3)2NH > CH3NH2 > (CH3)3N > NH3
(b) Arylamines versus ammonia
pKb value of aniline is quite high. Why is it so? It is because in
aniline or other arylamines, the -NH2 group is attached directly to
the benzene ring. It results in the unshared electron pair on nitrogen
atom to be in conjugation with the benzene ring and thus making
it less available for protonation. If you write different resonating
structures of aniline, you will find that aniline is a resonance
hybrid of the following five structures.

On the other hand, anilinium ion obtained by accepting a proton
can have only two resonating structures (kekule).

We know that greater the number of resonating structures, greater
is the stability. Thus you can infer that aniline (five resonating
structures) is more stable than anilinium ion. Hence, the proton
acceptability or the basic nature of aniline or other aromatic amines
would be less than that of ammonia. In case of substituted aniline, it
is observed that electron releasing groups like –OCH3, –CH3 increase
basic strength whereas electron withdrawing groups like –NO2, –SO3H,
–COOH, –X decrease it.

Solution The decreasing order of basic strength of the above amines and ammonia
follows the following order:
(C2H5)2NH > C2H5NH2 > NH3 > C6H5NH2
2. Alkylation
Amines undergo alkylation on reaction with alkyl halides (refer Unit
6, Class XII).
3. Acylation
Aliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary amines react with
acid chlorides, anhydrides and esters by nucleophilic substitution
reaction. This reaction is known as acylation. You can consider
this reaction as the replacement of hydrogen atom of –NH2 or >N–H
group by the acyl group. The products obtained by acylation reaction
are known as amides. The reaction is carried out in the presence of
a base stronger than the amine, like pyridine, which removes HCl so
formed and shifts the equilibrium to the right hand side.

Amines also react with benzoyl chloride (C6H5COCl). This reaction
is known as benzoylation.

4. Carbylamine reaction
Aliphatic and aromatic primary amines on heating with chloroform
and ethanolic potassium hydroxide form isocyanides or carbylamines
which are foul smelling substances. Secondary and tertiary amines
do not show this reaction. This reaction is known as carbylamine
reaction or isocyanide test and is used as a test for primary amines.
5. Reaction with nitrous acid
Three classes of amines react differently with nitrous acid which is
prepared in situ from a mineral acid and sodium nitrite.
(a) Primary aliphatic amines react with nitrous acid to form aliphatic
diazonium salts which being unstable, liberate nitrogen gas
quantitatively and alcohols. Quantitative evolution of nitrogen is
used in estimation of amino acids and proteins.

(b) Aromatic amines react with nitrous acid at low temperatures
(273-278 K) to form diazonium salts, a very important class of
compounds used for synthesis of a variety of aromatic compounds
discussed in Section 9.7.

Secondary and tertiary amines react with nitrous acid in a
different manner.
6. Reaction with arylsulphonyl chloride
Benzenesulphonyl chloride (C6H5SO2Cl), which is also known as
Hinsberg’s reagent, reacts with primary and secondary amines to
form sulphonamides.
(a) The reaction of benzenesulphonyl chloride with primary amine
yields N-ethylbenzenesulphonyl amide.

The hydrogen attached to nitrogen in sulphonamide is strongly
acidic due to the presence of strong electron withdrawing sulphonyl
group. Hence, it is soluble in alkali.
(b) In the reaction with secondary amine, N,N-diethylbenzenesulphonamide is formed.

Since N, N-diethylbenzene sulphonamide does not contain any
hydrogen atom attached to nitrogen atom, it is not acidic and hence
insoluble in alkali.
(c) Tertiary amines do not react with benzenesulphonyl chloride.
This property of amines reacting with benzenesulphonyl chloride
in a different manner is used for the distinction of primary,
secondary and tertiary amines and also for the separation of a
mixture of amines. However, these days benzenesulphonyl
chloride is replaced by p-toluenesulphonyl chloride.
7. Electrophilic substitution
You have read earlier that aniline is a resonance hybrid of five
structures. Where do you find the maximum electron density in
these structures? Ortho- and para-positions to the –NH2 group
become centres of high electron density. Thus –NH2 group is ortho
and para directing and a powerful activating group.
(a) Bromination: Aniline reacts with bromine water at room
temperature to give a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromoaniline.

The main problem encountered during electrophilic substitution
reactions of aromatic amines is that of their very high reactivity.
Substitution tends to occur at ortho- and para-positions. If we
have to prepare monosubstituted aniline derivative, how can
the activating effect of –NH2 group be controlled ? This can be
done by protecting the -NH2 group by acetylation with acetic
anhydride, then carrying out the desired substitution followed
by hydrolysis of the substituted amide to the substituted amine.

The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen of acetanilide interacts
with oxygen atom due to resonance as shown below:

Chemistry 272

Rationalised 2023-24

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

Hence, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is less available for
donation to benzene ring by resonance. Therefore, activating
effect of –NHCOCH3 group is less than that of amino group.
(b) Nitration: Direct nitration of aniline yields tarry oxidation
products in addition to the nitro derivatives. Moreover, in the
strongly acidic medium, aniline is protonated to form the
anilinium ion which is meta directing. That is why besides the
ortho and para derivatives, significant amount of meta derivative
is also formed.

However, by protecting the –NH2 group by acetylation reaction
with acetic anhydride, the nitration reaction can be controlled
and the p-nitro derivative can be obtained as the major product.

(c) Sulphonation: Aniline reacts with concentrated sulphuric acid
to form anilinium hydrogensulphate which on heating with
sulphuric acid at 453-473K produces p-aminobenzene sulphonic
acid, commonly known as sulphanilic acid, as the major product.

Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction (alkylation and
acetylation) due to salt formation with aluminium chloride, the
Lewis acid, which is used as a catalyst. Due to this, nitrogen of
aniline acquires positive charge and hence acts as a strong
deactivating group for further reaction.

The diazonium salts have the general formula R N 2 X where R stands

–

for an aryl group and X ion may be Cl Br, HSO 4 , BF4 , etc. They are
named by suffixing diazonium to the name of the parent hydrocarbon
from which they are formed, followed by the name of anion such as


chloride, hydrogensulphate, etc. The N 2 group is called diazonium

group. For example, C 6 H 5 N 2 Cl is named as benzenediazonium
+
–
chloride and C 6 H 5 N 2 HSO 4 is known as benzenediazonium
hydrogensulphate.
Primary aliphatic amines form highly unstable alkyldiazonium salts
(refer to Section 9.6). Primary aromatic amines form arenediazonium
salts which are stable for a short time in solution at low temperatures
(273-278 K). The stability of arenediazonium ion is explained on the
basis of resonance.

9.7 Method of
Preparation
of Diazoniun
Salts

Benzenediazonium chloride is prepared by the reaction of aniline with
nitrous acid at 273-278K. Nitrous acid is produced in the reaction
mixture by the reaction of sodium nitrite with hydrochloric acid. The
conversion of primary aromatic amines into diazonium salts is known
as diazotisation. Due to its instability, the diazonium salt is not
generally stored and is used immediately after its preparation.

Physical
Properties

9.9 Chemical
Reactions

Benzenediazonium chloride is a colourless crystalline solid. It is readily
soluble in water and is stable in cold but reacts with water when
warmed. It decomposes easily in the dry state. Benzenediazonium
fluoroborate is water insoluble and stable at room temperature.
The reactions of diazonium salts can be broadly divided into two
categories, namely (A) reactions involving displacement of nitrogen and
(B) reactions involving retention of diazo group.
A. Reactions involving displacement of nitrogen
Diazonium group being a very good leaving group, is substituted
–
– –
–
–
by other groups such as Cl , Br , I , CN and OH which displace
nitrogen from the aromatic ring. The nitrogen formed escapes from
the reaction mixture as a gas.

–
1. Replacement by halide or cyanide ion: The Cl , Br and CN
nucleophiles can easily be introduced in the benzene ring in the
presence of Cu(I) ion. This reaction is called Sandmeyer reaction.

Alternatively, chlorine or bromine can also be introduced in the
benzene ring by treating the diazonium salt solution with corresponding
halogen acid in the presence of copper powder. This is referred as
Gatterman reaction.

The yield in Sandmeyer reaction is found to be better than
Gattermann reaction.
2. Replacement by iodide ion: Iodine is not easily introduced into
the benzene ring directly, but, when the diazonium salt solution
is treated with potassium iodide, iodobenzene is formed.

3. Replacement by fluoride ion: When arenediazonium chloride is
treated with fluoroboric acid, arene diazonium fluoroborate is
precipitated which on heating decomposes to yield aryl fluoride.

4. Replacement by H: Certain mild reducing agents like
hypophosphorous acid (phosphinic acid) or ethanol reduce
diazonium salts to arenes and themselves get oxidised to
phosphorous acid and ethanal, respectively.

5. Replacement by hydroxyl group: If the temperature of the
diazonium salt solution is allowed to rise upto 283 K, the salt
gets hydrolysed to phenol.

6. Replacement by –NO2 group: When diazonium fluoroborate is
heated with aqueous sodium nitrite solution in the presence of
copper, the diazonium group is replaced by –NO2 group.

B. Reactions involving retention of diazo group
coupling reactions
The azo products obtained have an extended conjugate system having
both the aromatic rings joined through the –N=N– bond. These compounds
are often coloured and are used as dyes. Benzene diazonium chloride
reacts with phenol in which the phenol molecule at its para position is
coupled with the diazonium salt to form p-hydroxyazobenzene. This
type of reaction is known as coupling reaction. Similarly the reaction of
diazonium salt with aniline yields p-aminoazobenzene. This is an example
of electrophilic substitution reaction.

9 .10 Importance
of Diazonium
Salts in
Synthesis
of Aromatic
Compounds

From the above reactions, it is clear that the diazonium salts are very
good intermediates for the introduction of –F, –Cl, –Br, –I, –CN, –OH,
–NO2 groups into the aromatic ring.
Aryl fluorides and iodides cannot be prepared by direct halogenation.
The cyano group cannot be introduced by nucleophilic substitution of
chlorine in chlorobenzene but cyanobenzene can be easily obtained
from diazonium salt.
Thus, the replacement of diazo group by other groups is helpful in

Summary
Amines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia obtained by replacement of
hydrogen atoms with alkyl or aryl groups. Replacement of one hydrogen atom of
ammonia gives rise to structure of the type R-NH2, known as primary amine.
Secondary amines are characterised by the structure R2NH or R-NHR¢¢ and tertiary
¢. Secondary and tertiary amines are known as
amines by R3N, RNR¢¢R¢¢
¢¢ or R2NR¢.
simple amines if the alkyl or aryl groups are the same and mixed amines if the
groups are different. Like ammonia, all the three types of amines have one unshared
electron pair on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis bases.
Amines are usually formed from nitro compounds, halides, amides, imides, etc.
They exhibit hydrogen bonding which influence their physical properties. In
alkylamines, a combination of electron releasing, steric and H-bonding factors
influence the stability of the substituted ammonium cations in protic polar solvents
and thus affect the basic nature of amines. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger
bases than ammonia. In aromatic amines, electron releasing and withdrawing groups,
respectively increase and decrease their basic character. Aniline is a weaker base

than ammonia. Reactions of amines are governed by availability of the unshared pair
of electrons on nitrogen. Influence of the number of hydrogen atoms at nitrogen atom
on the type of reactions and nature of products is responsible for identification and
distinction between primary, secondary and tertiary amines. p-Toluenesulphonyl chloride
is used for the identification of primary, secondary and tertiary amines. Presence of
amino group in aromatic ring enhances reactivity of the aromatic amines. Reactivity of
aromatic amines can be controlled by acylation process, i.e., by treating with acetyl
chloride or acetic anhydride. Tertiary amines like trimethylamine are used as insect
attractants.
Aryldiazonium salts, usually obtained from arylamines, undergo replacement of
the diazonium group with a variety of nucleophiles to provide advantageous methods
for producing aryl halides, cyanides, phenols and arenes by reductive removal of the
diazo group. Coupling reaction of aryldiazonium salts with phenols or arylamines give
rise to the formation of azo dyes.

Unit

10
Biomolecules

Objectives
After studying this Unit, you will be
able to
• explain the characteristics of
biomolecules like carbohydrates,
proteins and nucleic acids and
hormones;
• classify carbohydrates, proteins,
nucleic acids and vitamins on the
basis of their structures;
• explain the difference between
DNA and RNA;
• describe the role of biomolecules
in biosystem.

10.1 Carbohydrates

“It is the harmonious and synchronous progress of chemical
reactions in body which leads to life”.

A living system grows, sustains and reproduces itself.
The most amazing thing about a living system is that it
is composed of non-living atoms and molecules. The
pursuit of knowledge of what goes on chemically within
a living system falls in the domain of biochemistry. Living
systems are made up of various complex biomolecules
like carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, etc.
Proteins and carbohydrates are essential constituents of
our food. These biomolecules interact with each other
and constitute the molecular logic of life processes. In
addition, some simple molecules like vitamins and
mineral salts also play an important role in the functions
of organisms. Structures and functions of some of these
biomolecules are discussed in this Unit.

Carbohydrates are primarily produced by plants and form a very large
group of naturally occurring organic compounds. Some common
examples of carbohydrates are cane sugar, glucose, starch, etc. Most of
them have a general formula, Cx(H2O)y, and were considered as hydrates
of carbon from where the name carbohydrate was derived. For example,
the molecular formula of glucose (C6H12O6) fits into this general formula,
C6(H2O)6. But all the compounds which fit into this formula may not be
classified as carbohydrates. For example acetic acid (CH3COOH) fits into
this general formula, C2(H2O)2 but is not a carbohydrate. Similarly,
rhamnose, C6H12O5 is a carbohydrate but does not fit in this definition.
A large number of their reactions have shown that they contain specific
functional groups. Chemically, the carbohydrates may be defined as
optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or the compounds
which produce such units on hydrolysis. Some of the carbohydrates,
which are sweet in taste, are also called sugars. The most common
sugar, used in our homes is named as sucrose whereas the sugar present

in milk is known as lactose. Carbohydrates are also called saccharides
(Greek: sakcharon means sugar).

10.1.1
Classification of
Carbohydrates

10.1.2
Monosaccharides

Carbohydrates are classified on the basis of their behaviour on
hydrolysis. They have been broadly divided into following three groups.
(i) Monosaccharides: A carbohydrate that cannot be hydrolysed further
to give simpler unit of polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone is called a
monosaccharide. About 20 monosaccharides are known to occur in
nature. Some common examples are glucose, fructose, ribose, etc.
(ii) Oligosaccharides: Carbohydrates that yield two to ten
monosaccharide units, on hydrolysis, are called oligosaccharides. They
are further classified as disaccharides, trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides,
etc., depending upon the number of monosaccharides, they provide
on hydrolysis. Amongst these the most common are disaccharides.
The two monosaccharide units obtained on hydrolysis of a disaccharide
may be same or different. For example, one molecule of sucrose on
hydrolysis gives one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose
whereas maltose gives two molecules of only glucose.
(iii) Polysaccharides: Carbohydrates which yield a large number of
monosaccharide units on hydrolysis are called polysaccharides.
Some common examples are starch, cellulose, glycogen, gums,
etc. Polysaccharides are not sweet in taste, hence they are also
called non-sugars.
The carbohydrates may also be classified as either reducing or nonreducing sugars. All those carbohydrates which reduce Fehling’s
solution and Tollens’ reagent are referred to as reducing sugars. All
monosaccharides whether aldose or ketose are reducing sugars.
Monosaccharides are further classified on the basis of number of carbon
atoms and the functional group present in them. If a monosaccharide
contains an aldehyde group, it is known as an aldose and if it contains
a keto group, it is known as a ketose. Number of carbon atoms
constituting the monosaccharide is also introduced in the name as is
evident from the examples given in Table 10.1

Glucose occurs freely in nature as well as in the combined form. It is
present in sweet fruits and honey. Ripe grapes also contain glucose
in large amounts. It is prepared as follows:
1. From sucrose (Cane sugar): If sucrose is boiled with dilute HCl or
H2SO4 in alcoholic solution, glucose and fructose are obtained in
equal amounts.

Glucose

Glucose is an aldohexose and is also known as dextrose. It is the
monomer of many of the larger carbohydrates, namely starch, cellulose.
It is probably the most abundant organic compound on earth. It was
assigned the structure given below on the basis of the following
evidences:
1. Its molecular formula was found to be C6H12O6.
2. On prolonged heating with HI, it forms n-hexane, suggesting that all
the six carbon atoms are linked in a straight chain.

Glucose

3. Glucose reacts with hydroxylamine to form an oxime and adds a
molecule of hydrogen cyanide to give cyanohydrin. These reactions
confirm the presence of a carbonyl group (>C = O) in glucose.

4. Glucose gets oxidised to six carbon carboxylic acid (gluconic acid)
on reaction with a mild oxidising agent like bromine water. This
indicates that the carbonyl group is present as an aldehydic group.

Glucose is correctly named as D(+)-glucose. ‘D’ before the name
of glucose represents the configuration whereas ‘(+)’ represents
dextrorotatory nature of the molecule. It should be remembered that
‘D’ and ‘L’ have no relation with the optical activity of the compound.
They are also not related to letter ‘d’ and ‘l’ (see Unit 6). The meaning
of D– and L– notations is as follows.
The letters ‘D’ or ‘L’ before the name of any compound indicate the
relative configuration of a particular stereoisomer of a compound with
respect to configuration of some other compound, configuration of
which is known. In the case of carbohydrates, this refers to their
relation with a particular isomer of glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde
contains one asymmetric carbon atom and exists in two enantiomeric
forms as shown below.

(+) Isomer of glyceraldehyde has ‘D’ configuration. It means that when
its structural formula is written on paper following specific conventions
which you will study in higher classes, the –OH group lies on right hand
side in the structure. All those compounds which can be chemically
correlated to D (+) isomer of glyceraldehyde are said to have Dconfiguration whereas those which can be correlated to ‘L’ (–) isomer of
glyceraldehyde are said to have L—configuration. In L (–) isomer –OH
group is on left hand side as you can see in the structure. For assigning

the configuration of monosaccharides, it is the lowest asymmetric carbon
atom (as shown below) which is compared. As in (+) glucose, —OH on
the lowest asymmetric carbon is on the right side which is comparable
to (+) glyceraldehyde, so (+) glucose is assigned D-configuration. Other
asymmetric carbon atoms of glucose are not considered for this
comparison. Also, the structure of glucose and glyceraldehyde is written
in a way that most oxidised carbon (in this case –CHO)is at the top.

The structure (I) of glucose explained most of its properties but the
following reactions and facts could not be explained by this structure.
1. Despite having the aldehyde group, glucose does not give Schiff’s
test and it does not form the hydrogensulphite addition product with
NaHSO3.
2. The pentaacetate of glucose does not react with hydroxylamine
indicating the absence of free —CHO group.
3. Glucose is found to exist in two different crystalline forms which are
named as a and b. The a-form of glucose (m.p. 419 K) is obtained by
crystallisation from concentrated solution of glucose at 303 K while
the b-form (m.p. 423 K) is obtained by crystallisation from hot and
saturated aqueous solution at 371 K.
This behaviour could not be explained by the open chain structure
(I) for glucose. It was proposed that one of the —OH groups may add
to the —CHO group and form a cyclic hemiacetal structure. It was
found that glucose forms a six-membered ring in which —OH at C-5
is involved in ring formation. This explains the absence of —CHO
group and also existence of glucose in two forms as shown below.
These two cyclic forms exist in equilibrium with open chain structure.

The two cyclic hemiacetal forms of glucose differ only in the
configuration of the hydroxyl group at C1, called anomeric carbon

(the aldehyde carbon before cyclisation). Such isomers, i.e., a-form
and b-form, are called anomers. The six membered cyclic structure
of glucose is called pyranose structure (a– or b–), in analogy with
pyran. Pyran is a cyclic organic compound with one oxygen atom
and five carbon atoms in the ring. The cyclic structure of glucose is
more correctly represented by Haworth structure as given below.

10.1.2.2 Fructose

Structure
of Fructose

Fructose is an important ketohexose. It is obtained along with glucose
by the hydrolysis of disaccharide, sucrose. It is a natural
monosaccharide found in fruits, honey and vegetables. In its pure
form it is used as a sweetner. It is also an important ketohexose.
Fructose also has the molecular formula C6H12O6 and
on the basis of its reactions it was found to contain a
ketonic functional group at carbon number 2 and six
carbons in straight chain as in the case of glucose. It
belongs to D-series and is a laevorotatory compound.
It is appropriately written as D-(–)-fructose. Its open
chain structure is as shown.
It also exists in two cyclic forms which are obtained
by the addition of —OH at C5 to the (
) group. The ring, thus formed
is a five membered ring and is named as furanose with analogy to the
compound furan. Furan is a five membered cyclic compound with one
oxygen and four carbon atoms.

The cyclic structures of two anomers of fructose are represented by
Haworth structures as given.

10.1.3
Disaccharides

You have already read that disaccharides on hydrolysis with dilute
acids or enzymes yield two molecules of either the same or different
monosaccharides. The two monosaccharides are joined together by an
oxide linkage formed by the loss of a water molecule. Such a linkage
between two monosaccharide units through oxygen atom is called
glycosidic linkage.
In disaccharides, if the reducing groups of monosaccharides i.e.,
aldehydic or ketonic groups are bonded, these are non-reducing sugars,
e.g., sucrose. On the other hand, sugars in which these functional groups
are free, are called reducing sugars, for example, maltose and lactose.
(i) Sucrose: One of the common disaccharides is sucrose which on
hydrolysis gives equimolar mixture of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-) fructose.

These two monosaccharides are held together by a glycosidic
linkage between C1 of a-D-glucose and C2 of b-D-fructose. Since
the reducing groups of glucose and fructose are involved in
glycosidic bond formation, sucrose is a non reducing sugar.

Sucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis gives
dextrorotatory glucose and laevorotatory fructose. Since the
laevorotation of fructose (–92.4°) is more than dextrorotation of
glucose (+ 52.5°), the mixture is laevorotatory. Thus, hydrolysis of
sucrose brings about a change in the sign of rotation, from dextro
(+) to laevo (–) and the product is named as invert sugar.
(ii) Maltose: Another disaccharide, maltose is composed of two
a-D-glucose units in which C1 of one glucose (I) is linked to C4
of another glucose unit (II). The free aldehyde group can be
produced at C1 of second glucose in solution and it shows reducing
properties so it is a reducing sugar.

(iii) Lactose: It is more commonly known as milk sugar since this
disaccharide is found in milk. It is composed of b-D-galactose and
b-D-glucose. The linkage is between C1 of galactose and C4 of
glucose. Free aldehyde group may be produced at C-1 of glucose
unit, hence it is also a reducing sugar.

10.1.4
Polysaccharides

Polysaccharides contain a large number of monosaccharide units joined
together by glycosidic linkages. These are the most commonly
encountered carbohydrates in nature. They mainly act as the food
storage or structural materials.
(i) Starch: Starch is the main storage polysaccharide of plants. It is
the most important dietary source for human beings. High content
of starch is found in cereals, roots, tubers and some vegetables. It
is a polymer of a-glucose and consists of two components—
Amylose and Amylopectin. Amylose is water soluble component
which constitutes about 15-20% of starch. Chemically amylose is
a long unbranched chain with 200-1000 a-D-(+)-glucose units
held together by C1– C4 glycosidic linkage.
Amylopectin is insoluble in water and constitutes about 8085% of starch. It is a branched chain polymer of a-D-glucose
units in which chain is formed by C1–C4 glycosidic linkage whereas
branching occurs by C1–C6 glycosidic linkage.

(ii) Cellulose: Cellulose occurs exclusively in plants and it is the most
abundant organic substance in plant kingdom. It is a predominant
constituent of cell wall of plant cells. Cellulose is a straight chain

polysaccharide composed only of b-D-glucose units which are
joined by glycosidic linkage between C1 of one glucose unit and
C4 of the next glucose unit.
(iii) Glycogen: The carbohydrates are stored in animal body as glycogen.
It is also known as animal starch because its structure is similar to
amylopectin and is rather more highly branched. It is present in liver,
muscles and brain. When the body needs glucose, enzymes break the
glycogen down to glucose. Glycogen is also found in yeast and fungi.

Importance of
Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are essential for life in both plants and animals. They
form a major portion of our food. Honey has been used for a long time
as an instant source of energy by ‘Vaids’ in ayurvedic system of
medicine. Carbohydrates are used as storage molecules as starch in
plants and glycogen in animals. Cell wall of bacteria and plants is
made up of cellulose. We build furniture, etc. from cellulose in the form

10.2 Proteins

Proteins are the most abundant biomolecules of the living system.
Chief sources of proteins are milk, cheese, pulses, peanuts, fish, meat,
etc. They occur in every part of the body and form the fundamental
basis of structure and functions of life. They are also required for
growth and maintenance of body. The word protein is derived from
Greek word, “proteios” which means primary or of prime importance.
All proteins are polymers of a-amino acids.

10.2.1 Amino
Acids

Amino acids contain amino (–NH2) and carboxyl (–COOH) functional
groups. Depending upon the relative position of amino group with
respect to carboxyl group, the amino acids can be
R CH COOH
classified as a, b, g, d and so on. Only a-amino
acids are obtained on hydrolysis of proteins. They
NH2
may contain other functional groups also.
a-amino acid
All a-amino acids have trivial names, which (R = side chain)
usually reflect the property of that compound or
its source. Glycine is so named since it has sweet taste (in Greek glykos
means sweet) and tyrosine was first obtained from cheese (in Greek, tyros
means cheese.) Amino acids are generally represented by a three letter
symbol, sometimes one letter symbol is also used. Structures of some
commonly occurring amino acids along with their 3-letter and 1-letter
symbols are given in Table 10.2.

Classification of
Amino Acids

Amino acids are classified as acidic, basic or neutral depending upon
the relative number of amino and carboxyl groups in their molecule.
Equal number of amino and carboxyl groups makes it neutral; more
number of amino than carboxyl groups makes it basic and more
carboxyl groups as compared to amino groups makes it acidic. The
amino acids, which can be synthesised in the body, are known as nonessential amino acids. On the other hand, those which cannot be
synthesised in the body and must be obtained through diet, are known
as essential amino acids (marked with asterisk in Table 10.2).

Amino acids are usually colourless, crystalline solids. These are
water-soluble, high melting solids and behave like salts rather than
simple amines or carboxylic acids. This behaviour is due to the presence
of both acidic (carboxyl group) and basic (amino
group) groups in the same molecule. In aqueous
solution, the carboxyl group can lose a proton
and amino group can accept a proton, giving rise
to a dipolar ion known as zwitter ion. This is
neutral but contains both positive and negative
charges.
In zwitter ionic form, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour as
they react both with acids and bases.
Except glycine, all other naturally occurring a-amino acids are
optically active, since the a-carbon atom is asymmetric. These exist
both in ‘D’ and ‘L’ forms. Most naturally occurring amino acids have
L-configuration. L-Aminoacids are represented by writing the –NH2 group
on left hand side.
10.2.3 Structure
of Proteins

You have already read that proteins are the polymers of a-amino acids
and they are connected to each other by peptide bond or peptide
linkage. Chemically, peptide linkage is an amide formed between
–COOH group and –NH2 group. The reaction between two molecules of
similar or different amino acids, proceeds through
the combination of the amino group of one molecule
with the carboxyl group of the other. This results in
the elimination of a water molecule and formation of
a peptide bond –CO–NH–. The product of the reaction
is called a dipeptide because it is made up of two
amino acids. For example, when carboxyl group of
glycine combines with the amino group of alanine
we get a dipeptide, glycylalanine.
If a third amino acid combines to a dipeptide, the product is called a
tripeptide. A tripeptide contains three amino acids linked by two peptide
linkages. Similarly when four, five or six amino acids are linked, the respective
products are known as tetrapeptide, pentapeptide or hexapeptide,
respectively. When the number of such amino acids is more than ten, then
the products are called polypeptides. A polypeptide with more than hundred
amino acid residues, having molecular mass higher than 10,000u is called
a protein. However, the distinction between a polypeptide and a protein is
not very sharp. Polypeptides with fewer amino acids are likely to be called
proteins if they ordinarily have a well defined conformation of a protein such
as insulin which contains 51 amino acids.
Proteins can be classified into two types on the basis of their
molecular shape.
(a) Fibrous proteins

When the polypeptide chains run parallel and are held together by
hydrogen and disulphide bonds, then fibre– like structure is formed. Such
proteins are generally insoluble in water. Some common examples are
keratin (present in hair, wool, silk) and myosin (present in muscles), etc.

(b) Globular proteins
This structure results when the chains of polypeptides coil around
to give a spherical shape. These are usually soluble in water. Insulin
and albumins are the common examples of globular proteins.
Structure and shape of proteins can be studied at four different
levels, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary, each level
being more complex than the previous one.
(i) Primary structure of proteins: Proteins may have
one or more polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide in a
protein has amino acids linked with each other in a
specific sequence and it is this sequence of amino acids
that is said to be the primary structure of that protein.
Any change in this primary structure i.e., the sequence
of amino acids creates a different protein.
(ii) Secondary structure of proteins: The secondary
structure of protein refers to the shape in which a long
polypeptide chain can exist. They are found to exist in
two different types of structures viz. a-helix and
b-pleated sheet structure. These structures arise due
to the regular folding of the backbone of the polypeptide
chain due to hydrogen bonding between

and

–NH– groups of the peptide bond.
a-Helix is one of the most common ways in which
a polypeptide chain forms all possible hydrogen bonds
by twisting into a right handed screw (helix) with the
–NH
group
of each amino acid residue hydrogen bonded to the
Fig. 10.1: a-Helix
C O of an adjacent turn of the helix as shown in Fig.10.1.
structure of proteins
In b-pleated sheet structure all peptide chains are
stretched out to nearly maximum extension and then
laid side by side which are held together by
intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The structure resembles
the pleated folds of drapery and therefore is known as
b-pleated sheet.
(iii) Tertiary structure of proteins: The tertiary
structure of proteins represents overall folding of the
polypeptide chains i.e., further folding of the secondary
structure. It gives rise to two major molecular shapes
viz. fibrous and globular. The main forces which
stabilise the 2° and 3° structures of proteins are
hydrogen bonds, disulphide linkages, van der Waals
and electrostatic forces of attraction.
Fig. 10.2: b-Pleated sheet structure of (iv) Quaternary structure of proteins: Some of the
proteins
proteins are composed of two or more polypeptide
chains referred to as sub-units. The spatial
arrangement of these subunits with respect to each
other is known as quaternary structure.

10.2.4
Denaturation of
Proteins

Protein found in a biological system with a unique three-dimensional
structure and biological activity is called a native protein. When a
protein in its native form, is subjected to physical change like change
in temperature or chemical change like change in pH, the hydrogen
bonds are disturbed. Due to this, globules unfold and helix get uncoiled
and protein loses its biological activity. This is called denaturation of

protein. During denaturation secondary and tertiary structures are
destroyed but primary structure remains intact. The coagulation of
egg white on boiling is a common example of denaturation. Another
example is curdling of milk which is caused due to the formation of
lactic acid by the bacteria present in milk.

10.3 Enzymes

Life is possible due to the coordination of various chemical reactions in
living organisms. An example is the digestion of food, absorption of
appropriate molecules and ultimately production of energy. This process
involves a sequence of reactions and all these reactions occur in the
body under very mild conditions. This occurs with the help of certain
biocatalysts called enzymes. Almost all the enzymes are globular
proteins. Enzymes are very specific for a particular reaction and for a
particular substrate. They are generally named after the compound or
class of compounds upon which they work. For example, the enzyme
that catalyses hydrolysis of maltose into glucose is named as maltase.
Maltase

 2 C6 H12 O6
Maltose

G lucose

Sometimes enzymes are also named after the reaction, where they
are used. For example, the enzymes which catalyse the oxidation of
one substrate with simultaneous reduction of another substrate are
named as oxidoreductase enzymes. The ending of the name of an
enzyme is -ase.
10.3.1 Mechanism
of Enzyme
Action

10.4 Vitamins

Enzymes are needed only in small quantities for the progress of a reaction.
Similar to the action of chemical catalysts, enzymes are said to reduce
the magnitude of activation energy. For example, activation energy for
acid hydrolysis of sucrose is 6.22 kJ mol–1, while the activation energy is
only 2.15 kJ mol–1 when hydrolysed by the enzyme, sucrase. Mechanism
for the enzyme action has been discussed.
It has been observed that certain organic compounds are required in
small amounts in our diet but their deficiency causes specific diseases.
These compounds are called vitamins. Most of the vitamins cannot be
synthesised in our body but plants can synthesise almost all of them,
so they are considered as essential food factors. However, the bacteria
of the gut can produce some of the vitamins required by us. All the
vitamins are generally available in our diet. Different vitamins belong
to various chemical classes and it is difficult to define them on the
basis of structure. They are generally regarded as organic compounds
required in the diet in small amounts to perform specific
biological functions for normal maintenance of optimum growth

and health of the organism. Vitamins are designated by alphabets
A, B, C, D, etc. Some of them are further named as sub-groups e.g. B1,
B2, B6, B12, etc. Excess of vitamins is also harmful and vitamin pills
should not be taken without the advice of doctor.
The term “Vitamine” was coined from the word vital + amine since
the earlier identified compounds had amino groups. Later work showed
that most of them did not contain amino groups, so the letter ‘e’ was
dropped and the term vitamin is used these days.
10.4.1
Classification of
Vitamins

Vitamins are classified into two groups depending upon their solubility
in water or fat.
(i) Fat soluble vitamins: Vitamins which are soluble in fat and oils
but insoluble in water are kept in this group. These are vitamins A,
D, E and K. They are stored in liver and adipose (fat storing) tissues.
(ii) Water soluble vitamins: B group vitamins and vitamin C are soluble
in water so they are grouped together. Water soluble vitamins must
be supplied regularly in diet because they are readily excreted in
urine and cannot be stored (except vitamin B12) in our body.
Some important vitamins, their sources and diseases caused by
their deficiency are listed in Table 10.3.

Every generation of each and every species resembles its ancestors in
many ways. How are these characteristics transmitted from one
generation to the next? It has been observed that nucleus of a living
cell is responsible for this transmission of inherent characters, also
called heredity. The particles in nucleus of the cell, responsible for
heredity, are called chromosomes which are made up of proteins and
another type of biomolecules called nucleic acids. These are mainly
of two types, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid
(RNA). Since nucleic acids are long chain polymers of nucleotides, so
they are also called polynucleotides.
James Dewey Watson

Born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1928, Dr Watson received his Ph.D.
(1950) from Indiana University in Zoology. He is best known for
his discovery of the structure of DNA for which he shared with
Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins the 1962 Nobel prize in
Physiology and Medicine. They proposed that DNA molecule takes
the shape of a double helix, an elegantly simple structure that
resembles a gently twisted ladder. The rails of the ladder are
made of alternating units of phosphate and the sugar deoxyribose;
the rungs are each composed of a pair of purine/ pyrimidine bases. This
research laid the foundation for the emerging field of molecular biology. The
complementary pairing of nucleotide bases explains how identical copies of
parental DNA pass on to two daughter cells. This research launched a revolution
in biology that led to modern recombinant DNA techniques.

of sugar moiety, we get a nucleotide (Fig. 10.5).

Information regarding the sequence of nucleotides in the chain
of a nucleic acid is called its primary structure. Nucleic acids
have a secondary structure also. James Watson and Francis Crick
gave a double strand helix structure for DNA (Fig. 10.7). Two
nucleic acid chains are wound about each other and held together
by hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases. The two strands are
complementary to each other because the hydrogen bonds are
formed between specific pairs of bases. Adenine forms hydrogen
bonds with thymine whereas cytosine forms hydrogen bonds
with guanine.
In secondary structure of RNA single stranded helics is present
which sometimes foldsback on itself. RNA molecules are of three
types and they perform different functions. They are named as
messenger RNA (m-RNA), ribosomal RNA (r-RNA) and transfer
RNA (t-RNA).

DNA Fingerprinting
It is known that every individual has unique fingerprints. These occur at the tips of
the fingers and have been used for identification for a long time but these can be
altered by surgery. A sequence of bases on DNA is also unique for a person and
information regarding this is called DNA fingerprinting. It is same for every cell and
cannot be altered by any known treatment. DNA fingerprinting is now used
(i) in forensic laboratories for identification of criminals.
(ii) to determine paternity of an individual.
(iii) to identify the dead bodies in any accident by comparing the DNA’s of parents or
children.
(iv) to identify racial groups to rewrite biological evolution.

10.5.3 Biological
Functions
of Nucleic
Acids

10.6 Hormones

DNA is the chemical basis of heredity and may be regarded as the reserve
of genetic information. DNA is exclusively responsible for maintaining
the identity of different species of organisms over millions of years. A
DNA molecule is capable of self duplication during cell division and
identical DNA strands are transferred to daughter cells. Another important
function of nucleic acids is the protein synthesis in the cell. Actually, the
proteins are synthesised by various RNA molecules in the cell but the
message for the synthesis of a particular protein is present in DNA.
Hormones are molecules that act as intercellular messengers. These
are produced by endocrine glands in the body and are poured directly
in the blood stream which transports them to the site of action.
In terms of chemical nature, some of these are steroids, e.g., estrogens
and androgens; some are poly peptides for example insulin and
endorphins and some others are amino acid derivatives such as
epinephrine and norepinephrine.
Hormones have several functions in the body. They help to maintain
the balance of biological activities in the body. The role of insulin in keeping
the blood glucose level within the narrow limit is an example of this
function. Insulin is released in response to the rapid rise in blood glucose
level. On the other hand hormone glucagon tends to increase the glucose
level in the blood. The two hormones together regulate the glucose level
in the blood. Epinephrine and norepinephrine mediate responses to
external stimuli. Growth hormones and sex hormones play role in growth
and development. Thyroxine produced in the thyroid gland is an iodinated
derivative of amino acid tyrosine. Abnormally low level of thyroxine leads

Chemistry 300

Rationalised 2023-24

Buy latest Educart Books on Amazon - https://amzn.to/3OwEosm

to hypothyroidism which is characterised by lethargyness and obesity.
Increased level of thyroxine causes hyperthyroidism. Low level of iodine
in the diet may lead to hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid
gland. This condition is largely being controlled by adding sodium iodide
to commercial table salt (“Iodised” salt).
Steroid hormones are produced by adrenal cortex and gonads (testes
in males and ovaries in females). Hormones released by the adrenal cortex
play very important role in the functions of the body. For example,
glucocorticoids control the carbohydrate metabolism, modulate
inflammatory reactions, and are involved in reactions to stress. The
mineralocorticoids control the level of excretion of water and salt by the
kidney. If adrenal cortex does not function properly then one of the results
may be Addison’s disease characterised by hypoglycemia, weakness and
increased susceptibility to stress. The disease is fatal unless it is treated by
glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Hormones released by gonads are
responsible for development of secondary sex characters. Testosterone is
the major sex hormone produced in males. It is responsible for development
of secondary male characteristics (deep voice, facial hair, general physical
constitution) and estradiol is the main female sex hormone. It is responsible
for development of secondary female characteristics and participates in
the control of menstrual cycle. Progesterone is responsible for preparing
the uterus for implantation of fertilised egg.

Summary
Carbohydrates are optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or molecules which
provide such units on hydrolysis. They are broadly classified into three groups —
monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides. Glucose, the most important
source of energy for mammals, is obtained by the digestion of starch. Monosaccharides
are held together by glycosidic linkages to form disaccharides or polysaccharides.
Proteins are the polymers of about twenty different a-amino acids which are
linked by peptide bonds. Ten amino acids are called essential amino acids because
they cannot be synthesised by our body, hence must be provided through diet. Proteins
perform various structural and dynamic functions in the organisms. Proteins which
contain only a-amino acids are called simple proteins. The secondary or tertiary
structure of proteins get disturbed on change of pH or temperature and they are not
able to perform their functions. This is called denaturation of proteins. Enzymes are
biocatalysts which speed up the reactions in biosystems. They are very specific and
selective in their action and chemically majority of enzymes are proteins.
Vitamins are accessory food factors required in the diet. They are classified as
fat soluble (A, D, E and K) and water soluble (B group and C). Deficiency of vitamins
leads to many diseases.

Nucleic acids are the polymers of nucleotides which in turn consist of a base,
a pentose sugar and phosphate moiety. Nucleic acids are responsible for the transfer
of characters from parents to offsprings. There are two types of nucleic acids —
DNA and RNA. DNA contains a five carbon sugar molecule called 2-deoxyribose
whereas RNA contains ribose. Both DNA and RNA contain adenine, guanine and
cytosine. The fourth base is thymine in DNA and uracil in RNA. The structure of
DNA is a double strand whereas RNA is a single strand molecule. DNA is the
chemical basis of heredity and have the coded message for proteins to be synthesised
in the cell. There are three types of RNA — mRNA, rRNA and tRNA which actually
carry out the protein synthesis in the cell.
